the shape of his lighthouse on that of an [232]oak tree, using


waves to dissipate on impact with the walls. His lighthouse was the


prototype for the modern lighthouse and influenced all subsequent

Stevenson worked for the [249]Northern Lighthouse Board for nearly


construction and later improvement of numerous lighthouses. He


innovated in the choice of light sources, mountings, reflector design,


providing lighthouses with individual signatures allowing them to be

In modern automated lighthouses, the system of rotating lenses is often


replaced by a high intensity light that emits brief omnidirectional


flashes, concentrating the light in time rather than direction. These


lights are similar to obstruction lights used to warn aircraft of tall


structures. Later innovations were "Vega Lights", and experiments with
