   The heart wants what the heart wants, but there are ways to soothe your
   soul, and to lighten your heavy heart.

   Write down your heart.
--
   just write.

   Expression will lighten your heavy heart.

   Find the blessings.
--
   give them room to rush in.

   Hope will lighten your heavy heart.

   Make time to heal.

   You need time, and there is no good answer to “how long?” It will take
   as long as it takes. You can’t rush your heart. We said goodbye to our
   sweet dog Guinness more than 6 months ago. My heart is lighter than it
   was in the days that followed that painful goodbye, but there are still
   days when I get teary, or really, really miss him.

   Patience will lighten your heavy heart.

   Take action.
--
   isn’t enough. It is.

   Contribution will lighten your heavy heart.

   Share your heart.
--

   Solidarity will lighten your heavy heart.

   If your heart is heavy today, and it’s too soon to consider these
   recommendations, come back when you’re ready. In the meantime, be open
   to the light and look for the stars.
