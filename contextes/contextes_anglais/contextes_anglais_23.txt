What is light pollution?

Definition of light pollution

   Light pollution is the human-made alteration of outdoor light levels
   from those occurring naturally.

   When we over-light, fail to use timers and sensors, or use the wrong
   color of light, we can negatively affect many parts of our world,
   including migratory birds, pollinators, sea turtles, and mammals,
   including humans.

Light can be a pollutant

   Most of us are familiar with air pollution, water pollution, and land
   pollution, but did you know that light can also be a pollutant?

   Components of light pollution include:
     * Glare — excessive brightness that causes visual discomfort
     * Sky glow — brightening of the night sky over inhabited areas
     * Light trespass — light falling where it is not intended or needed
     * Clutter — bright, confusing, and excessive groupings of light
       sources

What causes light pollution?

   Light pollution is a side effect of industrial civilization.

   Its sources include building exterior and interior lighting,
   advertising, commercial properties, offices, factories, streetlights,
   and illuminated sporting venues.

What can be done?

   Light pollution affects every citizen. Fortunately, concern about light
   pollution is rising dramatically. A growing number of scientists,
   homeowners, environmental groups, and civic leaders are taking action
   to restore the natural night.

   The good news is that light pollution, unlike many other forms of
   pollution, is reversible, and each one of us can make a difference!
   Just being aware that light pollution is a problem is not enough — we
   need to take action.
