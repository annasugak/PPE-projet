What does ‘lite’ or ‘light’ mean?

   It might mean the product has less energy (kJ) or fat than the original
   formula. But it could also mean it's light in colour or flavour, as in
   'light' olive oil, or light in cut, as in 'lite' potato chips. Read the
   nutrition panel to see what's really going on.
