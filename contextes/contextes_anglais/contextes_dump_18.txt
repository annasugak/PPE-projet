Light in a vacuum is generally held to travel at an absolute speed, but


light traveling through any material can be slowed down. The amount


that a material slows down light is called its refractive index. Light


For example, light traveling through Earth's atmosphere moves almost as


fast as light in a vacuum, slowing down by just three ten-thousandths


of the speed of light. But light passing through a diamond slows to
