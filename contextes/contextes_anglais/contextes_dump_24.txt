What is a light-year?


A light-year is how astronomers measure distance in space. It’s defined


by how far a beam of light travels in one year – a distance of six

they use a beam of light as their reference.


Why do things this way? First, light is convenient. Throughout the


universe, all light travels at exactly the same speed: about 670


million miles per hour. We don’t usually think about light traveling


anywhere because when we flick on a light switch – there it is! We


don’t have to wait for the room to light up. It happens


quick the speed of light is.


If you could travel at the speed of light, you could circle the globe

takes about a second-and-a-half, at light speed. Travel to the sun at


light speed takes about eight minutes. Can you even imagine? Traveling


A light beam needs only 8 minutes to travel the 93 million miles (150


The fact that light takes time to get anywhere has an interesting side


effect. If light from the sun takes eight minutes to get to us, then


seconds after they happened. The same happens with light: we only see


something once the light from that event actually gets to our eyes.

The main reason for using light years, however, is because the
