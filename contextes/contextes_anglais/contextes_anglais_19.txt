   Refraction and the Ray Model of Light - Lesson 2 - The Mathematics of
   Refraction

   Useful for the Check Your Understanding and See Answers.

   Refraction is the bending of the path of a light wave as it passes
   across the boundary separating two media. Refraction is caused by the
   change in speed experienced by a wave when it changes medium. Lesson 1,
   focused on the topics of "What causes refraction?" and "Which direction
   does light refract?" In that lesson, we learned that light can either
   refract towards the normal (when slowing down while crossing the
   boundary) or away from the normal (when speeding up while crossing the
   boundary). The focus of Lesson 2 is upon the question of "By how much
   does light refract when it crosses a boundary?" In the first part of
   Lesson 2, we learned that a comparison of the angle of refraction to
   the angle of incidence provides a good measure of the refractive
   ability of any given boundary. The more that light refracts, the bigger
   the difference between these two angles. In this part of Lesson 2, we
   will learn about a mathematical equation relating these two angles and

   exact center of the dish. The angle of incidence can be measured at the
   point of incidence. This ray will refract, bending towards the normal
   (since the light is passing from a medium in which it travels fast into
   one in which it travels slow - FST). Once the light ray enters the
   water, it travels in a straight line until it reaches the second
   boundary. At the second boundary, the light ray is approaching along
   the normal to the curved surface (this stems from the geometry of
   circles). The ray does not refract upon exiting since the angle of
   incidence is 0-degrees (recall the If I Were An Archer Fish page). The
   ray of laser light therefore exits at the same angle as the refracted
   ray of light made at the first boundary. These two angles can be
   measured and recorded. The angle of incidence of the laser beam can be
   changed to 5-degrees and new measurements can be made and recorded.

   The equation relating the angles of incidence (Θ[i]) and the angle of
   refraction (Θ[r]) for light passing from air into water is given as

   proportionality would be 1.51 - the index of refraction value of
   Plexiglas. This is not just a coincidence. The same pattern would
   result for light traveling from air into any material. Experimentally,
   it is found that for a ray of light traveling from air into some
   material, the following equation can be written.

           where n[material] = index of refraction of the material

   This study of the refraction of light as it crosses from one material
   into a second material yields a general relationship between the sines
   of the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction. This general

   This relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction and
   the indices of refraction of the two media is known as Snell's Law.
   Snell's law applies to the refraction of light in any situation,
   regardless of what the two media are.

   Snell's Law provides the quantitative means of answering the question
   of "By how much does the light ray refract?" The task of answering this
   question involves using indices of refraction and the angle of
   incidence values in order to determine the angle of refraction. This

   Laser light is shown passing into and out of a hemi-cylindrical dish
   filled with water. The light enters the water (at the curved side of
   the dish) along the normal line; no bending occurs upon entry. The
   light continues through the water along a straight line until it
   reaches the boundary with air (at the flat side of the dish). The angle
   of incidence in the water is approximately 39°. At this angle, the
   light refracts out of the water into the surrounding air bending away
   from the normal. The angle of refraction in the air is approximately
   57°. These values for the angle of incidence and refraction are
