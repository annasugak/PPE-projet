What is a light-year?

   Light-year is the distance light travels in one year. Light zips
   through interstellar space at 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per
   second and 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers) per year.

   We use light-time to measure the vast distances of space.

   It’s the distance that light travels in a specific period of time.
   Also: LIGHT IS FAST, nothing travels faster than light.

   How far can light travel in one minute? 11,160,000 miles. It takes 43.2
   minutes for sunlight to reach Jupiter, about 484 million miles away.
   Light is fast, but the distances are vast. In an hour, light can travel
   671 million miles.

   Earth is about eight light minutes from the Sun. A trip at light-speed
   to the very edge of our solar system – the farthest reaches of the Oort
   Cloud, a collection of dormant comets way, way out there – would take
   about 1.87 years. Keep going to Proxima Centauri, our nearest
   neighboring star, and plan on arriving in 4.25 years at light speed.

   stretching across the universe, interspersed with dark voids and
   lending the whole a kind of spiderweb structure. Our galaxy probably
   contains 100 to 400 billion stars, and is about 100,000 light-years
   across. That sounds huge, and it is, at least until we start comparing
   it to other galaxies. Our neighboring Andromeda galaxy, for example, is
   some 220,000 light-years wide. Another galaxy, IC 1101, spans as much
   as 4 million light-years.

   Based on observations by NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope, we can

   The nearest-known exoplanet is a small, probably rocky planet orbiting
   Proxima Centauri – the next star over from Earth. A little more than
   four light-years away, or 24 trillion miles. If an airline offered a
   flight there by jet, it would take 5 million years. Not much is known
   about this world; its close orbit and the periodic flaring of its star
   lower its chances of being habitable.

   The TRAPPIST-1 system is seven planets, all roughly in Earth’s size
   range, orbiting a red dwarf star about 40 light-years away. They are
   very likely rocky, with four in the “habitable zone” – the orbital
   distance allowing potential liquid water on the surface. And computer

   One of the most distant exoplanets known to us in the Milky Way is
   Kepler-443 b. Traveling at light speed, it would take 3,000 years to
   get there. Or 28 billion years, going 60 mph.
