   Key Takeaways
     * Blue light is a wavelength of light often emitted by electronic
       devices and artificial lights.
     * During the day, blue light influences your circadian rhythm,
       affecting alertness and heart rate.
     * Limiting blue light at night can help mitigate its effects on
       sleep.

   The screens of electronic devices such as smartphones, computers,
   tablets, and televisions can emit blue light that disrupts our natural
   sleep cycles. Research shows that a majority of Americans use
   electronic devices within an hour of going to bed, which can lead to
   unsatisfactory sleep. Decreasing exposure to light in the evening, and
   blue light in particular, is an important way to help your body
   naturally prepare for sleep and get quality rest.

What Is Blue Light?

   Light is composed of electromagnetic radiation, which is an invisible
   form of energy. Our eyes interpret colors of light based on the amount
   of energy they contain. White light, including some light emitted by
   the sun, is the combination of all the colors of the visible light
   spectrum.

   Blue light is a portion of the visible light spectrum that can
   influence alertness, hormone production, and sleep cycles. This
   wavelength of light is emitted by LED and fluorescent lights, as well
   as many electronic devices.

How Does Blue Light Affect Circadian Rhythms?

   improve performance and attention, tuning our circadian rhythms and
   setting us up for a better night’s sleep after the sun sets.

   Strategically timed exposure to blue light can help treat several sleep
   disorders. Circadian rhythm disorders occur when a person’s circadian

What Devices Emit Blue Light?

   Many people work under artificial lights and constantly interact with
   the screens of electronic devices. Being aware of these common sources
   of artificial blue light can help you strategically time exposure and
   avoid circadian rhythm disruptions.

   Common sources of blue light include:
     * Fluorescent lights
     * LED lights
     * Smartphones
     * Televisions

     * Video game consoles

   The good news is that the risks of nighttime blue light exposure can be
   reduced through relatively simple methods.

Mitigating the Effects of Blue Light

   The most effective way to reduce exposure to blue light in the evening
   is to simply turn off the sources. This means dimming or reducing LED
   and fluorescent lighting in your home and turning off electronic
   devices after it gets dark outside.

   Specialty glasses may also be helpful in reducing exposure to blue
   light. While they may not work for everyone, blue light blocking or
   amber glasses can reduce the melatonin-suppressing effects of bright
   light Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information

   It may not always be feasible to turn off sources of blue light after
   dark, but there are a variety of ways to reduce blue light exposure
   that may be interfering with your sleep.
     * Make it a routine: Set an alarm that reminds you to turn off
       electronics two to three hours before bedtime.
     * Use a different lamp: If you enjoy reading in bed, try a lamp that
       emits red or orange light rather than blue.
     * Learn to dim: Dim the brightness of your electronic screens, or use
       the “night mode” feature found on some devices.
     * Try an app: If you need to use devices before bed, try out one of
       several smartphone and computer applications that can help reduce
       blue light emission.
     * Improve your sleeping environment: If there are light sources in
       your bedroom that you are unable to dim or turn off, try using an
       eye mask to block them out once you are in bed.
