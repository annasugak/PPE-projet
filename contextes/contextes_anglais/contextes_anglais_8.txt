   When you're with friends, maybe even neighbors, and the invitation to
   play is just that - an invitation. And everybody is there for no other
   reason than to have fun together. You become lighthearted. And the
   light of your lighthearted heart is shared. A weight is lifted. A
   separation healed. A connection made visible.

   It becomes a light that illuminates everything.

   You feel a certain trust in each other, a certain certainty. People are
--
   without alcohol even. So nothing can come between you and the
   authenticity of your experience. It's really you. Really them. It's
   magic, is what it is, this shared light, this heart. The fun of it all
   is so much more encompassing simply because you're doing it freely,
   together, in full consciousness, wholeheartedly and wholebodily.

   This is the way it is when you come together to for fun.

   You let loose. You let the light of being together into your very
   heart. You let the fun in. You let each other in.

   Laughing hearts. Loving hearts. Light hearts. Much, very much, to the
   delight of all.
