What is the visible light spectrum?

   The visible light spectrum is the segment of the electromagnetic
   spectrum that the human eye can view. More simply, this range of
   wavelengths is called visible light. Typically, the human eye can
   detect wavelengths from 380 to 700 nanometers.

WAVELENGTHS OF VISIBLE LIGHT

   All electromagnetic radiation is light, but we can only see a small
   portion of this radiation—the portion we call visible light.
   Cone-shaped cells in our eyes act as receivers tuned to the wavelengths
   in this narrow band of the spectrum. Other portions of the spectrum

   biological limitations of our perception.

   As the full spectrum of visible light travels through a prism, the
   wavelengths separate into the colors of the rainbow because each color
   is a different wavelength. Violet has the shortest wavelength, at
   around 380 nanometers, and red has the longest wavelength, at around
   700 nanometers.
   Left: A 3D illustration of 2 prisms. As light shine through one, it is
   refracted into the colors of the rainbow. As the full spectrum of light
   - the rainbow - travels through the second prism, the waves are
   recombined into white light. Right: illustration of each wavelength in
   the spectrum

   visible light andthat each color refracts at a slightly different angle
   depending on the wavelength of the color.Credit: Troy Benesch.(Right)

THE SUN'S CORONA

   The Sun is the dominant source for visible-light waves our eyes
   receive. The outer-most layer of the Sun's atmosphere, the corona, can
   be seen in visible light. But it is so faint it cannot not be seen
   except during a total solar eclipse because the bright photosphere
   overwhelms it. The photograph below was taken during a total eclipse of

   field lines extending millions of miles into space.

   streamers that are normally too faint to see over the intense light of

   their temperature.

   Our Sun produces more yellow light than any other color because its
   surface temperature is 5,500°C. If the Sun's surface were cooler—say
   3,000°C—it would look reddish, like the star Betelgeuse. If the Sun

SPECTRA AND SPECTRAL SIGNATURES

   Close examination of the visible-light spectrum from our Sun and other
   stars reveals a pattern of dark lines—called absorption lines. These
   patterns can provide important scientific clues that reveal hidden
   properties of objects throughout the universe. Certain elements in the
   Sun's atmosphere absorb certain colors of light. These patterns of
   lines within spectra act like fingerprints for atoms and molecules.
   Looking at the Sun's spectrum, for example, the fingerprints for
   elements are clear to those knowledgeable about those patterns.

   called a spectral signature. Spectral signatures of different Earth
   features within the visible light spectrum ARE shown below.
