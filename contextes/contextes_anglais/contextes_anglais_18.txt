   The speed of light traveling through a vacuum is exactly 299,792,458
   meters (983,571,056 feet) per second. That's about 186,282 miles per
   second — a universal constant known in equations as "c," or light
   speed.

   According to physicist Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity,
   on which much of modern physics is based, nothing in the universe can
   travel faster than light. The theory states that as matter approaches
   the speed of light, the matter's mass becomes infinite. That means the
   speed of light functions as a speed limit for the whole universe.

   The speed of light is so immutable that, according to the U.S. National
   Institute of Standards and Technology, it is used to define
   international standard measurements like the meter (and by extension,

   But despite the speed of light's reputation as a universal constant,
   scientists and science fiction writers alike spend time contemplating
   faster-than-light travel. So far no one's been able to demonstrate a
   real warp drive, but that hasn't slowed our collective hurtle toward
   new stories, new inventions and new realms of physics.

What is a light-year?

   A light-year is the distance that light can travel in one year — about
   6 trillion miles (10 trillion kilometers). It's one way that
   astronomers and physicists measure immense distances across our
   universe.

   Light travels from the moon to our eyes in about 1 second, which means
   the moon is about 1 light-second away. Sunlight takes about 8 minutes
   to reach our eyes, so the sun is about 8 light minutes away. Light from
   Alpha Centauri, which is the nearest star system to our own, requires
   roughly 4.3 years to get here, so Alpha Centauri is 4.3 light-years
   away.

   "To obtain an idea of the size of a light-year, take the circumference
   of the Earth (24,900 miles), lay it out in a straight line, multiply
   the length of the line by 7.5 (the corresponding distance is one
   light-second), then place 31.6 million similar lines end to end,"
   NASA's Glenn Research Center says on its website. "The resulting
   distance is almost 6 trillion (6,000,000,000,000) miles!"

How long would it take humans to travel one light year?

   An airplane traveling 600 mph (965 km/h) would take 1 million years to
   travel a single light-year! If we could travel one light-year using a
   crewed spacecraft like the Apollo lunar module, the journey would take
   approximately 27,000 years, according to the BBC Sky at Night Magazine.

   Stars and other objects beyond our solar system lie anywhere from a few
   light-years to a few billion light-years away. And everything
   astronomers "see" in the distant universe is literally history. When
   astronomers study objects that are far away, they are seeing light that
   shows the objects as they existed at the time that light left them.

   This principle allows astronomers to see the universe as it looked
   after the Big Bang, which took place about 13.8 billion years ago.
   Objects that are 10 billion light-years away from us appear to
   astronomers as they looked 10 billion years ago — relatively soon after
   the beginning of the universe — rather than how they appear today.

What is faster than the speed of light?

   Nothing! Light is a "universal speed limit" and, according to
   Einstein's theory of relativity, is the fastest speed in the universe:
   300,000 kilometers per second (186,000 miles per second).

Is the speed of light constant?

   The speed of light is a universal constant in a vacuum, like the vacuum
   of space. However, light *can* slow down slightly when it passes
   through an absorbing medium, like water (225,000 kilometers per second
   = 140,000 miles per second) or glass (200,000 kilometers per second =
   124,000 miles per second).

Who discovered the speed of light?

   One of the first measurements of the speed of light was by Ole Rømer in
   1676 by observing the moons of Jupiter. The speed of light was first
   measured to high precision in 1879 by the Michelson-Morley Experiment.

How do we know the speed of light?

   Ole Rømer was able to measure the speed of light by observing eclipses
   of Jupiter's moon Io. When Jupiter was closer to Earth, Rømer noted
   that eclipses of Io occurred slightly earlier than when Jupiter was
   farther away. Rømer attributed this effect to the time it takes for
   light to travel over the longer distance when Jupiter was farther from
   the Earth.

How did we learn the speed of light?

   countless other philosophers and physicists in history have
   contemplated the speed of light. (Image credit: NASA)

   As early as the 5th century BC, Greek philosophers like Empedocles and
   Aristotle disagreed on the nature of light speed. Empedocles proposed
   that light, whatever it was made of, must travel and therefore, must
   have a rate of travel. Aristotle wrote a rebuttal of Empedocles' view
   in his own treatise, On Sense and the Sensible, arguing that light,
   unlike sound and smell, must be instantaneous. Aristotle was wrong, of
   course, but it would take hundreds of years for anyone to prove it.
--
   lantern. One uncovered his lantern; when the other person saw the
   flash, he uncovered his too. But Galileo's experimental distance wasn't
   far enough for his participants to record the speed of light. He could
   only conclude that light traveled at least 10 times faster than sound.

   In the 1670s, Danish astronomer Ole Rømer tried to create a reliable
   timetable for sailors at sea, and according to NASA, accidentally came
   up with a new best estimate for the speed of light. To create an
   astronomical clock, he recorded the precise timing of the eclipses of
   Jupiter's moon, Io, from Earth. Over time, Rømer observed that Io's
--
   approaching and occurred on schedule when the planets were at their
   closest or farthest points. This observation demonstrated what we today
   know as the Doppler effect, the change in frequency of light or sound
   emitted by a moving object that in the astronomical world manifests as
   the so-called redshift, the shift towards "redder", longer wavelengths
   in objects speeding away from us. In a leap of intuition, Rømer
   determined that light was taking measurable time to travel from Io to
   Earth.

   Rømer used his observations to estimate the speed of light. Since the
   size of the solar system and Earth's orbit wasn't yet accurately known,
   argued a 1998 paper in the American Journal of Physics, he was a bit
   off. But at last, scientists had a number to work with. Rømer's
   calculation put the speed of light at about 124,000 miles per second
   (200,000 km/s).

   In 1728, English physicist James Bradley based a new set of
   calculations on the change in the apparent position of stars caused by
   Earth's travels around the sun. He estimated the speed of light at
   185,000 miles per second (301,000 km/s) — accurate to within about 1%
   of the real value, according to the American Physical Society.

   Two new attempts in the mid-1800s brought the problem back to Earth.
   French physicist Hippolyte Fizeau set a beam of light on a rapidly
   rotating toothed wheel, with a mirror set up 5 miles (8 km) away to
   reflect it back to its source. Varying the speed of the wheel allowed
   Fizeau to calculate how long it took for the light to travel out of the
   hole, to the adjacent mirror, and back through the gap. Another French
   physicist, Leon Foucault, used a rotating mirror rather than a wheel to
   perform essentially the same experiment. The two independent methods
   each came within about 1,000 miles per second (1,609 km/s) of the speed
   of light.

   most accurate measurement of the speed of light. (Image credit:
   Getty/Bettman)

   Another scientist who tackled the speed of light mystery was
   Poland-born Albert A. Michelson, who grew up in California during the
   state's gold rush period, and honed his interest in physics while
   attending the U.S. Naval Academy, according to the University of
   Virginia. In 1879, he attempted to replicate Foucault's method of
   determining the speed of light, but Michelson increased the distance
   between mirrors and used extremely high-quality mirrors and lenses.
   Michelson's result of 186,355 miles per second (299,910 km/s) was
   accepted as the most accurate measurement of the speed of light for 40
   years, until Michelson re-measured it himself. In his second round of
   experiments, Michelson flashed lights between two mountain tops with
   carefully measured distances to get a more precise estimate. And in his
   third attempt just before his death in 1931, according to the
   Smithsonian's Air and Space magazine, he built a mile-long
   depressurized tube of corrugated steel pipe. The pipe simulated a
   near-vacuum that would remove any effect of air on light speed for an
   even finer measurement, which in the end was just slightly lower than
   the accepted value of the speed of light today.

   Michelson also studied the nature of light itself, wrote astrophysicist
   Ethan Siegal in the Forbes science blog, Starts With a Bang. The best
   minds in physics at the time of Michelson's experiments were divided:
   Was light a wave or a particle?

   Michelson, along with his colleague Edward Morley, worked under the
   assumption that light moved as a wave, just like sound. And just as
   sound needs particles to move, Michelson and Morley and other
   physicists of the time reasoned, light must have some kind of medium to
   move through. This invisible, undetectable stuff was called the
   "luminiferous aether" (also known as "ether").
--
   very basic version of the instrument used today in LIGO facilities),
   Michelson could not find evidence of any kind of luminiferous aether
   whatsoever. Light, he determined, can and does travel through a vacuum.

   "The experiment — and Michelson's body of work — was so revolutionary
--
   universe than any success would have been!"

Special relativity and the speed of light

   Albert Einstein writing on a blackboard.
   Einstein's theory of special relativity unified energy, matter and the
   speed of light in a famous equation: E = mc^2. (Image credit: NASA)

   Einstein's theory of special relativity unified energy, matter and the
   speed of light in a famous equation: E = mc^2. The equation describes
   the relationship between mass and energy — small amounts of mass (m)
   contain, or are made up of, an inherently enormous amount of energy
   (E). (That's what makes nuclear bombs so powerful: They're converting
   mass into blasts of energy.) Because energy is equal to mass times the
   speed of light squared, the speed of light serves as a conversion
   factor, explaining exactly how much energy must be within matter. And
   because the speed of light is such a huge number, even small amounts of
   mass must equate to vast quantities of energy.

   To accurately describe the universe, Einstein's elegant equation
   requires the speed of light to be an immutable constant. Einstein
   asserted that light moved through a vacuum, not any kind of
   luminiferous aether, and in such a way that it moved at the same speed
   no matter the speed of the observer.
--
   Think of it like this: Observers sitting on a train could look at a
   train moving along a parallel track and think of its relative movement
   to themselves as zero. But observers moving nearly the speed of light
   would still perceive light as moving away from them at more than 670
   million mph. (That's because moving really, really fast is one of the
   only confirmed methods of time travel — time actually slows down for
--
   observer moving slowly.)

   In other words, Einstein proposed that the speed of light doesn't vary
   with the time or place that you measure it, or how fast you yourself
   are moving.

   Therefore, objects with mass cannot ever reach the speed of light. If
   an object ever did reach the speed of light, its mass would become
   infinite. And as a result, the energy required to move the object would
   also become infinite: an impossibility.

   That means if we base our understanding of physics on special
   relativity (which most modern physicists do), the speed of light is the
   immutable speed limit of our universe — the fastest that anything can
   travel.

What goes faster than the speed of light?

   Although the speed of light is often referred to as the universe's
   speed limit, the universe actually expands even faster. The universe
   expands at a little more than 42 miles (68 kilometers) per second for
   each megaparsec of distance from the observer, wrote astrophysicist
   Paul Sutter in a previous article for Space.com. (A megaparsec is 3.26
   million light-years — a really long way.)

   In other words, a galaxy 1 megaparsec away appears to be traveling away
--

   "At some point, at some obscene distance, the speed tips over the
   scales and exceeds the speed of light, all from the natural, regular
   expansion of space," Sutter explained. "It seems like it should be
   illegal, doesn't it?"
--
   neither should you."

Does light ever slow down?

   A sparkling diamond amongst dark coal-like rock.
   Light moves more slowly when traveling through diamond than when moving
   through air, and it moves through air slightly slower than it can
   travel in a vacuum. (Image credit: Shutterstock)

   Light in a vacuum is generally held to travel at an absolute speed, but
   light traveling through any material can be slowed down. The amount
   that a material slows down light is called its refractive index. Light
   bends when coming into contact with particles, which results in a
   decrease in speed.

   For example, light traveling through Earth's atmosphere moves almost as
   fast as light in a vacuum, slowing down by just three ten-thousandths
   of the speed of light. But light passing through a diamond slows to
   less than half its typical speed, PBS NOVA reported. Even so, it
   travels through the gem at over 277 million mph (almost 124,000 km/s) —
   enough to make a difference, but still incredibly fast.

   Light can be trapped — and even stopped — inside ultra-cold clouds of
   atoms, according to a 2001 study published in the journal Nature. More
   recently, a 2018 study published in the journal Physical Review Letters
   proposed a new way to stop light in its tracks at "exceptional points,"
   or places where two separate light emissions intersect and merge into
   one.

   Researchers have also tried to slow down light even when it's traveling
   through a vacuum. A team of Scottish scientists successfully slowed
   down a single photon, or particle of light, even as it moved through a
   vacuum, as described in their 2015 study published in the journal
   Science. In their measurements, the difference between a slowed photon
   and a "regular" photon was just a few millionths of a meter, but it
   demonstrated that light in a vacuum can be slower than the official
   speed of light.
