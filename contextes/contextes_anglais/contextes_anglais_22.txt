   'Red shift' is a key concept for astronomers. The term can be
   understood literally - the wavelength of the light is stretched, so the
   light is seen as 'shifted' towards the red part of the spectrum.

   Something similar happens to sound waves when a source of sound moves
--
   recedes.

   Light behaves like a wave, so light from a luminous object undergoes a
   Doppler-like shift if the source is moving relative to us. Ever since
   1929, when Edwin Hubble discovered that the Universe is expanding, we
   have known that most other galaxies are moving away from us. Light from
   these galaxies is shifted to longer (and this means redder) wavelengths
   - in other words, it is 'red-shifted'.

   Since light travels at such a great speed relative to everyday
   phenomena (a million times faster than sound) we do not experience this
   red shift in our daily lives.
