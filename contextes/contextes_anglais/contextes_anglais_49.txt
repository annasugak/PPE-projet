   A lighthouse is a tower, building, or other type of physical structure
   designed to emit light from a system of lamps and lenses and to serve
   as a beacon for navigational aid for maritime pilots at sea or on
   inland waterways.

   Lighthouses mark dangerous coastlines, hazardous shoals, reefs, rocks,
   and safe entries to harbors; they also assist in aerial navigation.
   Once widely used, the number of operational lighthouses has declined
   due to the expense of maintenance and the advent of much cheaper, more
   sophisticated, and more effective electronic navigational systems.

Ancient lighthouses

   [edit]
   [250px-Torre_de_H%C3%A9rcules_2023.jpg] The Tower of Hercules
   lighthouse in north-western Spain

   Before the development of clearly defined ports, mariners were guided
   by fires built on hilltops. Since elevating the fire would improve
   visibility, placing the fire on a platform became a practice that led
   to the development of the lighthouse.^[1] In antiquity, the lighthouse
   functioned more as an entrance marker to ports than as a warning signal
   for reefs and promontories, unlike many modern lighthouses. The most
   famous lighthouse structure from antiquity was the Pharos of
   Alexandria, Egypt, which collapsed following a series of earthquakes
   between 956 and 1323.

   The intact Tower of Hercules at A Coruña, Spain gives insight into
   ancient lighthouse construction; other evidence about lighthouses
   exists in depictions on coins and mosaics, of which many represent the
   lighthouse at Ostia. Coins from Alexandria, Ostia, and Laodicea in
   Syria also exist.

--
   [edit]

   The modern era of lighthouses began at the turn of the 18th century, as
   the number of lighthouses being constructed increased significantly due
   to much higher levels of transatlantic commerce. Advances in structural
   engineering and new and efficient lighting equipment allowed for the
   creation of larger and more powerful lighthouses, including ones
   exposed to the sea. The function of lighthouses was gradually changed
   from indicating ports to the providing of a visible warning against
   shipping hazards, such as rocks or reefs.
   [250px-Edystone_Winstanley_lighthouse_Smeaton_1813.jpg] Original
   Winstanley lighthouse, Eddystone Rock, by Jaaziell Johnston, 1813.

   The Eddystone Rocks were a major shipwreck hazard for mariners sailing
   through the English Channel.^[2] The first lighthouse built there was
   an octagonal wooden structure, anchored by 12 iron stanchions secured
   in the rock, and was built by Henry Winstanley from 1696 to 1698. His
   lighthouse was the first tower in the world to have been fully exposed
   to the open sea.^[3]

   The civil engineer John Smeaton rebuilt the lighthouse from 1756 to
   1759;^[4] his tower marked a major step forward in the design of
   lighthouses and remained in use until 1877. He modeled the shape of his
   lighthouse on that of an oak tree, using granite blocks. He
   rediscovered and used "hydraulic lime", a form of concrete that will
   set under water used by the Romans, and developed a technique of
--
   gentle gradient. This profile had the added advantage of allowing some
   of the energy of the waves to dissipate on impact with the walls. His
   lighthouse was the prototype for the modern lighthouse and influenced
   all subsequent engineers.^[6]
   [321px-Smeaton%27s_Lighthouse00.jpg] John Smeaton's rebuilt version of
   the Eddystone Lighthouse, 1759. This represented a great step forward
   in lighthouse design.

   One such influence was Robert Stevenson, himself a seminal figure in
   the development of lighthouse design and construction.^[7] His greatest
   achievement was the construction of the Bell Rock Lighthouse in 1810,
   one of the most impressive feats of engineering of the age.^[citation
   needed] This structure was based upon Smeaton's design, but with
   several improved features, such as the incorporation of rotating
   lights, alternating between red and white.^[8] Stevenson worked for the
   Northern Lighthouse Board for nearly fifty years^[7] during which time
   he designed and oversaw the construction and later improvement of
   numerous lighthouses. He innovated in the choice of light sources,
   mountings, reflector design, the use of Fresnel lenses, and in rotation
   and shuttering systems providing lighthouses with individual signatures
   allowing them to be identified by seafarers. He also invented the
   movable jib and the balance-crane as a necessary part for lighthouse
   construction.
   [330px-Marjaniemen_majakka.jpg] Marjaniemi Lighthouse, the 19th-century

   Finland

   Alexander Mitchell designed the first screw-pile lighthouse – his
   lighthouse was built on piles that were screwed into the sandy or muddy
   seabed. Construction of his design began in 1838 at the mouth of the
   Thames and was known as the Maplin Sands lighthouse, and first lit in
   1841.^[9] Although its construction began later, the Wyre Light in
   Fleetwood, Lancashire, was the first to be lit (in 1840).^[9]

Lighting improvements

   [edit]
--
   Until 1782 the source of illumination had generally been wood pyres or
   burning coal. The Argand lamp, invented in 1782 by the Swiss scientist
   Aimé Argand revolutionized lighthouse illumination with its steady
   smokeless flame. Early models used ground glass which was sometimes
   tinted around the wick. Later models used a mantle of thorium dioxide
   suspended over the flame, creating a bright, steady light.^[10] The
   Argand lamp used whale oil, colza, olive oil^[11] or other vegetable
   oil as fuel, supplied by a gravity feed from a reservoir mounted above
   the burner. The lamp was first produced by Matthew Boulton, in
   partnership with Argand, in 1784, and became the standard for
   lighthouses for over a century.^[12]

   Souter Lighthouse was the first lighthouse to be built for the purpose
   of electric illumination in 1871.^[13]

   South Foreland Lighthouse was the first tower to successfully use an
   electric light in 1875. The lighthouse's carbon arc lamps were powered
   by a steam-driven magneto.^[14] John Richardson Wigham was the first to
   develop a system for gas illumination of lighthouses. His improved gas
   'crocus' burner at the Baily Lighthouse in county Dublin, Ireland, near
   Dublin city was 13 times more powerful than the most brilliant light
   then known.^[15]

   Brothers Incandescent Petroleum Vapour Installation which produced the
   light for the Sumburgh Head lighthouse until 1976. The lamp (made in
   approx. 1914) burned vaporized kerosene (paraffin); the vaporizer was
   heated by a denatured alcohol (methylated spirit) burner to light. When
   lit, some of the vaporised fuel was diverted to a Bunsen burner to keep
   the vaporizer warm and the fuel in vapor form. The fuel was forced up
--
   improved by David Hood at Trinity House. The fuel was vaporized at high
   pressure and burned to heat the mantle, giving an output of over six
   times the luminosity of traditional oil lights.^[citation needed] The
   use of gas as illuminant became widely available with the invention of
   the Dalén light by Swedish engineer Gustaf Dalén. He used Agamassan
   (Aga), a substrate, to absorb the gas, allowing the gas to be stored,
   and hence used, safely. Dalén also invented the 'sun valve', which
   automatically regulated the light and turned it off during the
   daytime.^[This paragraph needs citation(s)] The technology was the
   predominant light source in lighthouses from the 1900s to the 1960s,
   when electric lighting had become dominant.^[16]

Optical systems

   [edit]
   [250px-Fresnel_lighthouse_lens_diagram.png] Diagram depicting how a
   spherical Fresnel lens collimates light

   With the development of the steady illumination of the Argand lamp, the
   application of optical lenses to increase and focus the light intensity
   became a practical possibility. William Hutchinson developed the first
   practical optical system in 1777, known as a catoptric system.^[17]
   This rudimentary system effectively collimated the emitted light into a
   concentrated beam, thereby greatly increasing the light's
   visibility.^[18] The ability to focus the light led to the first
   revolving lighthouse beams, where the light would appear to the
   mariners as a series of intermittent flashes. It also became possible
   to transmit complex signals using the light flashes.

   French physicist and engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel developed the
   multi-part Fresnel lens for use in lighthouses. His design allowed for
   the construction of lenses of large aperture and short focal length,
   without the mass and volume of material that would be required by a
   lens of conventional design. A Fresnel lens can be made much thinner
   than a comparable conventional lens, in some cases taking the form of a
   flat sheet. A Fresnel lens can also capture more oblique light from a
   light source, thus allowing the light from a lighthouse equipped with
   one to be visible over greater distances.

   The first Fresnel lens was used in 1823 in the Cordouan lighthouse at
   the mouth of the Gironde estuary; its light could be seen from more
   than 20 miles (32 km) out.^[19] Fresnel's invention increased the
   luminosity of the lighthouse lamp by a factor of four and his system is
   still in common use.

Modern lighthouses

   [edit]

   The introduction of electrification and automatic lamp changers began
   to make lighthouse keepers obsolete. For many years, lighthouses still
   had keepers, partly because lighthouse keepers could serve as a rescue
   service, if necessary. Improvements in maritime navigation and safety,
   such Global Positioning System (GPS), led to the phasing out of
   non-automated lighthouses across the world.^[20] Although several
   closed due to safety concerns, Canada still maintains 51 staffed
   lighthouses, split roughly evenly across east and west coasts,
   including Machias Seal Island which is staffed to assert Canadian
   sovereignty.^[21]^[22]^[23]

   The remaining modern lighthouses are usually illuminated by a single
   stationary flashing light powered by solar-charged batteries and
   mounted on a steel skeleton tower.^[24] Where the power requirement is
   too great for solar power alone, cycle charging of the battery by a
--
   maintenance.^[25]

Famous lighthouse builders

   [edit]

   John Smeaton is noteworthy for having designed the third and most
   famous Eddystone Lighthouse, but some builders are well known for their
   work in building multiple lighthouses. The Stevenson family (Robert,
   Alan, David, Thomas, David Alan, and Charles) made lighthouse building
   a three-generation profession in Scotland. Richard Henry Brunton
   designed and built 26 Japanese lighthouses in Meiji era Japan, which
   became known as Brunton's "children".^[26] Blind Irishman Alexander
   Mitchell invented and built a number of screw-pile lighthouses.
   Englishman James Douglass was knighted for his work on the fourth
   Eddystone Lighthouse.^[27]

   United States Army Corps of Engineers Lieutenant George Meade built
   numerous lighthouses along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts before gaining
   wider fame as the winning general at the Battle of Gettysburg. Colonel
   Orlando M. Poe, engineer to General William Tecumseh Sherman in the
   siege of Atlanta, designed and built some of the most exotic
   lighthouses in the most difficult locations on the U.S. Great
   Lakes.^[28]

   French merchant navy officer Marius Michel Pasha built almost a hundred
   lighthouses along the coasts of the Ottoman Empire in a period of
   twenty years after the Crimean War (1853–1856).^[29]

   [edit]

   In a lighthouse, the source of light is called the "lamp" (whether
   electric or fuelled by oil) and the light is concentrated, if needed,
   by the "lens" or "optic". Power sources for lighthouses in the
   20th–21st centuries vary.

--
   lamp and parabolic reflector were introduced in the late 18th century.

   Whale oil was also used with wicks as the source of light. Kerosene
   became popular in the 1870s and electricity and acetylene gas derived
   on-site from calcium carbide began replacing kerosene around the turn
   of the 20th century.^[24] Carbide was promoted by the Dalén light,
   which automatically lit the lamp at nightfall and extinguished it at
   dawn.

   In the second half of the 20th century, many remote lighthouses in
   Russia (then Soviet Union) were powered by radioisotope thermoelectric
   generators (RTGs). These had the advantage of providing power day or
   night and did not need refuelling or maintenance. However, after the
   collapse of the Soviet government in 1990s, most of the official
   records on the locations, and condition, of these lighthouses were
   reportedly lost.^[30] Over time, the condition of RTGs in Russia
   degraded; many of them fell victim to vandalism and scrap metal
--
   contents.^[31]

   Energy-efficient LED lights can be powered by solar panels, with
   batteries instead of a Diesel generator for backup.^[32]

Light source

   [edit]
--
   aerobeacons, which require less maintenance.

   In modern automated lighthouses, the system of rotating lenses is often
   replaced by a high intensity light that emits brief omnidirectional
   flashes, concentrating the light in time rather than direction. These
   lights are similar to obstruction lights used to warn aircraft of tall
   structures. Later innovations were "Vega Lights", and experiments with
   light-emitting diode (LED) panels.^[24]

   LED lights, which use less energy and are easier to maintain, had come
   into widespread use by 2020. In the United Kingdom and Ireland about a
   third of lighthouses had been converted from filament light sources to
   use LEDs, and conversion continued with about three per year. The light
   sources are designed to replicate the colour and character of the
   traditional light as closely as possible. The change is often not
   noticed by people in the region, but sometimes a proposed change leads
   to calls to preserve the traditional light, including in some cases a
   rotating beam. A typical LED system designed to fit into the
   traditional 19th century Fresnel lens enclosure was developed by
   Trinity House and two other lighthouse authorities and costs about
   €20,000, depending on configuration, according to a supplier; it has
   large fins to dissipate heat. Lifetime of the LED light source is
   50,000 to 100,000 hours, compared to about 1,000 hours for a filament
   source.^[32]

Laser light

   [edit]
   [250px-Point_Danger_lighthouse.jpg] Point Danger lighthouse,
   Queensland, 1971

   Experimental installations of laser lights, either at high power to
   provide a "line of light" in the sky or, utilising low power, aimed
   towards mariners have identified problems of increased complexity in
   installation and maintenance, and high power requirements. The first
   practical installation, in 1971 at Point Danger lighthouse, Queensland,
   was replaced by a conventional light after four years, because the beam
   was too narrow to be seen easily.^[33]^[34]

Light characteristics

   [edit]
   See also: Light characteristic

   In any of these designs an observer, rather than seeing a continuous
   weak light, sees a brighter light during short time intervals. These
   instants of bright light are arranged to create a light characteristic
   or pattern specific to a lighthouse.^[35] For example, the Scheveningen
   Lighthouse flashes are alternately 2.5 and 7.5 seconds. Some lights
   have sectors of a particular color (usually formed by colored panes in
   the lantern) to distinguish safe water areas from dangerous shoals.
   Modern lighthouses often have unique reflectors or racon transponders
   so the radar signature of the light is also unique.

Lens
--
   [edit]
   See also: Fresnel lens
   [250px-Cape_Meares_Lighthouse_lens_-_Oregon.jpg] Cape Meares Lighthouse
   in Oregon; first-order Fresnel lens

   Before modern strobe lights, lenses were used to concentrate the light
   from a continuous source. Vertical light rays of the lamp are
   redirected into a horizontal plane, and horizontally the light is
   focused into one or a few directions at a time, with the light beam
   swept around. As a result, in addition to seeing the side of the light
   beam, the light is directly visible from greater distances, and with an
   identifying light characteristic.

   This concentration of light is accomplished with a rotating lens
   assembly. In early lighthouses, the light source was a kerosene lamp
   or, earlier, an animal or vegetable oil Argand lamp, and the lenses
   rotated by a weight driven clockwork assembly wound by lighthouse
   keepers, sometimes as often as every two hours. The lens assembly
   sometimes floated in liquid mercury to reduce friction. In more modern
   lighthouses, electric lights and motor drives were used, generally
   powered by diesel electric generators. These also supplied electricity
   for the lighthouse keepers.^[24]

   Efficiently concentrating the light from a large omnidirectional light
   source requires a very large diameter lens. This would require a very
   thick and heavy lens if a conventional lens were used. The Fresnel lens
   (pronounced /freɪˈnɛl/) focused 85% of a lamp's light versus the 20%
   focused with the parabolic reflectors of the time. Its design enabled
   construction of lenses of large size and short focal length without the
   weight and volume of material in conventional lens designs.^[36]

   Fresnel lighthouse lenses are ranked by order, a measure of refracting
   power, with a first order lens being the largest, most powerful and
   expensive; and a sixth order lens being the smallest. The order is
   based on the focal length of the lens. A first order lens has the
   longest focal length, with the sixth being the shortest. Coastal
   lighthouses generally use first, second, or third order lenses, while
   harbor lights and beacons use fourth, fifth, or sixth order
   lenses.^[37]

   Some lighthouses, such as those at Cape Race, Newfoundland, and Makapuu
   Point, Hawaii, used a more powerful hyperradiant Fresnel lens
   manufactured by the firm of Chance Brothers.

   While lighthouse buildings differ depending on the location and
   purpose, they tend to have common components.

   A light station comprises the lighthouse tower and all outbuildings,
   such as the keeper's living quarters, fuel house, boathouse, and
   fog-signaling building. The Lighthouse itself consists of a tower
   structure supporting the lantern room where the light operates.

   The lantern room is the glassed-in housing at the top of a lighthouse
   tower containing the lamp and lens. Its glass storm panes are supported
   by metal muntins (glazing bars) running vertically or diagonally. At
   the top of the lantern room is a stormproof ventilator designed to
   remove the smoke of the lamps and the heat that builds in the glass
   enclosure. A lightning rod and grounding system connected to the metal
   cupola roof provides a safe conduit for any lightning strikes.

   Immediately beneath the lantern room is usually a Watch Room or Service
--
   prepared the lanterns for the night and often stood watch. The
   clockworks (for rotating the lenses) were also located there. On a
   lighthouse tower, an open platform called the gallery is often located
   outside the watch room (called the Main Gallery) or Lantern Room
   (Lantern Gallery). This was mainly used for cleaning the outside of the
   windows of the Lantern Room.^[38]

   Lighthouses near to each other that are similar in shape are often
   painted in a unique pattern so they can easily be recognized during
   daylight, a marking known as a daymark. The black and white barber pole
   spiral pattern of Cape Hatteras Lighthouse is one example. Race Rocks
   Light in western Canada is painted in horizontal black and white bands
   to stand out against the horizon.

   {\displaystyle D=1.22{\sqrt {H}}} , where H is the height above water
   in feet, and D is the distance from the lighthouse to the horizon in
   nautical miles, the lighthouse range.^[39]

   Where dangerous shoals are located far off a flat sandy beach, the
   prototypical tall masonry coastal lighthouse is constructed to assist
   the navigator making a landfall after an ocean crossing. Often these
   are cylindrical to reduce the effect of wind on a tall structure, such
   as Cape May Light. Smaller versions of this design are often used as
   harbor lights to mark the entrance into a harbor, such as New London
   Harbor Light.

   Where a tall cliff exists, a smaller structure may be placed on top
   such as at Horton Point Light. Sometimes, such a location can be too
   high, for example along the west coast of the United States, where
   frequent low clouds can obscure the light. In these cases, lighthouses
   are placed below the clifftop to ensure that they can still be seen at
   the surface during periods of fog or low clouds, as at Point Reyes
   Lighthouse. Another example is in San Diego, California: the Old Point
   Loma lighthouse was too high up and often obscured by fog, so it was
   replaced in 1891 with a lower lighthouse, New Point Loma
   lighthouse.^[This paragraph needs citation(s)]

   As technology advanced, prefabricated skeletal iron or steel structures
   tended to be used for lighthouses constructed in the 20th century.
   These often have a narrow cylindrical core surrounded by an open
   lattice work bracing, such as Finns Point Range Light.

   Sometimes a lighthouse needs to be constructed in the water itself.
   Wave-washed lighthouses are masonry structures constructed to withstand
   water impact, such as Eddystone Lighthouse in Britain and the St.
   George Reef Light of California. In shallower bays, Screw-pile
   lighthouse ironwork structures are screwed into the seabed and a low
   wooden structure is placed above the open framework, such as Thomas
   Point Shoal Lighthouse. As screw piles can be disrupted by ice, steel
   caisson lighthouses such as Orient Point Light are used in cold
   climates. Orient Long Beach Bar Light (Bug Light) is a blend of a screw
   pile light that was converted to a caisson light because of the threat
   of ice damage.^[40] Skeletal iron towers with screw-pile foundations
   were built on the Florida Reef along the Florida Keys, beginning with
   the Carysfort Reef Light in 1852.^[41]

   In waters too deep for a conventional structure, a lightship might be
   used instead of a lighthouse, such as the former lightship Columbia.
   Most of these have now been replaced by fixed light platforms (such as
   Ambrose Light) similar to those used for offshore oil exploration.^[37]

Range lights

   [edit]
   Main article: Range lights
   [250px-Margaree_Harbour_Range_Lights.jpg] Range Lights in Margaree
   Harbour, Nova Scotia. When a vessel is on the correct course, the two
   lights align one above the other.

   Aligning two fixed points on land provides a navigator with a line of
--
   Ranges can be used to precisely align a vessel within a narrow channel
   such as a river. With landmarks of a range illuminated with a set of
   fixed lighthouses, nighttime navigation is possible.

   Such paired lighthouses are called range lights in North America and
   leading lights in the United Kingdom. The closer light is referred to
   as the beacon or front range; the further light is called the rear
   range. The rear range light is almost always taller than the front.

   When a vessel is on the correct course, the two lights align
   vertically, but when the observer is out of position, the difference in
   alignment indicates the direction of travel to correct the course.

   India[250px-Europa_Point_Lighthouse.jpg] Lighthouse at Europa Point,
   Gibraltar

   There are two types of lighthouses: ones that are located on land, and
   ones that are offshore.

   Offshore Lighthouses are lighthouses that are not close to land.^[42]
   There can be a number of reasons for these lighthouses to be built.
   Offshore lighthouses are commonly used to project sovereignty or
   territorial assertions over maritime claims, often having manifested as
   early public services and state building.^[43] Examples of such
   lighthouses include the Raffles Lighthouse which asserts Singapore's
   southern maritime claims, the Subi Reef lighthouse which asserts the
   disputed Chinese claim over the South China Seas, and Machias Seal
   Island lighthouse which affirms Canada's disputed claim in its boundary
   dispute with the United States of America in the Gulf of Maine and the
   Bay of Fundy. There can be a shoal, reef or submerged island several
   miles from land.

   The current Cordouan Lighthouse was completed in 1611, 7 kilometres
   (4.3 mi) from the shore on a small islet, but was built on a previous
   lighthouse that can be traced back to the 880s and is the oldest
   surviving lighthouse in France. It is connected to the mainland by a
   causeway. The oldest surviving oceanic offshore lighthouse is Bell Rock
   Lighthouse in the North Sea, off the coast of Scotland.^[44]

   [edit]

   As lighthouses became less essential to navigation, many of their
   historic structures faced demolition or neglect. In the United States,
   the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000 provides for
   the transfer of lighthouse structures to local governments and private
   non-profit groups, while the USCG continues to maintain the lamps and
   lenses. In Canada, the Nova Scotia Lighthouse Preservation Society won
   heritage status for Sambro Island Lighthouse, and sponsored the
   Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act to change Canadian federal laws to
   protect lighthouses.^[48]

   Many groups formed to restore and save lighthouses around the world,
   including the World Lighthouse Society and the United States Lighthouse
   Society,^[49] as well as the Amateur Radio Lighthouse Society, which
   sends amateur radio operators to publicize the preservation of remote
   lighthouses throughout the world.^[50]
