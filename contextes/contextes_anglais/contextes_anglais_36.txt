   Moser developed an accessible and effective way to illuminate indoor
   spaces during the day. Using only a PET bottle installed on the roof,
   filled with water and bleach, he harnessed the refraction of sunlight
   to bring brightness to spaces previously immersed in darkness. In
   self-built homes, where successive extensions often compromise natural
   light and ventilation, this solution makes a significant difference.
   Named the "Moser lamp," the invention produces illumination equivalent
   to a 60W bulb and gained worldwide recognition through various reports.

   Emotional Design - Featured Image Courtesy of Vibia

   When designing and lighting a space, is the goal to fulfill a specific
   requirement or to be creative? Both perspectives hold merit; however, a
   unifying principle should always prevail: people must remain at the
--
   performance, even in challenging contexts such as outer space. While
   this standpoint has encompassed anthropometric and biological aspects,
   new approaches are expanding design beyond the tangible. Lighting is
   now used to shape atmospheres that resonate deeply with our emotions.

   title of the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world. Among its
   most remarkable elements is the central oculus — an 8.2-meter-wide
   opening at the top of the dome that allows natural light to enter. This
   creates a dynamic play of light and shadow that shifts throughout the
   day, enhancing the grandeur of the structure. Beyond its practical
   function, the oculus establishes a symbolic connection between the
   earthly and the divine, reflecting the Pantheon's original purpose as a
   temple dedicated to all gods. In fact, toplighting, which introduces
   natural light from above through skylights, domes, or other upper
   openings, contrasts with traditional windows, which capture light
   horizontally. By capturing direct sunlight, toplighting provides soft,
   diffuse illumination, creating more welcoming environments with better
   energy efficiency and a positive impact on mood and productivity.

   From subtle light beams to wide openings, skylights transform natural
   light into a powerful architectural tool, creating a dynamic interplay
   of light and shadow that adds movement and vitality to buildings. This
   intricate dance captivates not only with the patterns the light casts
   on surfaces but also with the practical benefits of overhead lighting,
   such as improved thermal comfort and enhanced well-being.

   Robert Wilson embodies the roles of director, set designer,
   scenographer, lighting designer, and architect in a single figure.
   Internationally celebrated as a pioneer of stage lighting and honored
   with numerous prestigious awards, including the Golden Lion of the
   Venice Biennale and the Praemium Imperiale, Wilson, now in his
   eighties, continues to travel the world, staging remarkable
   productions. His use of light and color is marked by precision and
   minimalism, creating scenes that skillfully oscillate between stillness
   and drama. During rehearsals at the Düsseldorf Schauspielhaus, he
   elaborates on the interplay between stage and architecture, his
   creative process, and the profound impact of light on darkness.

   Step into the realm where the minimalism of the 1960s Light and Space
   movement intertwines with contemporary high-tech algorithms and
   sensors. Back then, light artists like James Turrell, Dan Flavin, and
   Robert Irwin captivated audiences with the bare essentials, using
   precisely daylight or lamps to heighten visual perception. Fast forward
   to today, Chromasonic takes this synergy of light and color but
   augments it with sound and algorithms. Envisioned as a global network
   to experience the harmony of body and mind, Johannes Girardoni's team
   unveiled the first satellite of perception in the heart of Venice
   Beach, California. Through a collaboration with Google, Milan Design
   Week showcased how the interplay of light and color can go on tour as a
   walk-in installation on a larger scale.
