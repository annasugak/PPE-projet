   Traffic lights, traffic signals, or stoplights – also known as robots
   in South Africa,^[1]^[2] Zambia, and Namibia – are signalling devices
   positioned at road intersections, pedestrian crossings, and other
   locations in order to control the flow of traffic.^[3]

   Traffic lights usually consist of three signals, transmitting
   meaningful information to road users through colours and symbols,
   including arrows and bicycles. The usual traffic light colours are red
   to stop traffic, amber for traffic change, and green to allow traffic
   to proceed. These are arranged vertically or horizontally in that
   order. Although this is internationally standardised,^[4] variations in
   traffic light sequences and laws exist on national and local
   scales.^[5]

   Traffic lights were first introduced in December 1868 on Parliament
   Square in London to reduce the need for police officers to control
   traffic.^[6] Since then, electricity and computerised control have
   advanced traffic light technology and increased intersection
   capacity.^[7] The system is also used for other purposes, including the
   control of pedestrian movements, variable lane control (such as tidal

   Main article: History of traffic lights

   In December 1868, the first traffic signals showing a red or green
   light at night were installed outside the Houses of Parliament in
   London.^[8] A police constable raised or lowered the semaphore arms
   and, at night, operated a lever to control the lights which drivers and
   pedestrians saw.^[9] This system exploded on 2 January 1869 and was
   taken down. This early traffic signal led to other parts of the world
--
   to direct traffic.^[10]

   In 1912, the first electric traffic light was developed by Lester Wire,
   a policeman in Salt Lake City, Utah.^[11] In August 1914, it was
   installed by the American Traffic Signal Company on the corner of East
   105th Street and Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio.^[12]^[13]^[14] In
   1920, the first four-way, three-colour traffic light was created by
   William Potts in Detroit, Michigan.^[15] His design was the first to
   include an amber 'caution' light along with red and green lights.^[16]
   Potts was Superintendent of Signals for the Police Department of
   Detroit. In 1921, he installed automatic four-way, three-colour traffic
   lights in 15 towers across Detroit.^[17]^[16]^[15]

   By 1922, traffic towers were beginning to be controlled by automatic

   able to reassign all but 500 of its 6,000 officers working on the
   traffic squad, saving the city $12,500,000.^[18] In 1923, Garrett
   Morgan patented a design of a manually operated three-way traffic light
   with moving arms.^[19]

   The control of traffic lights changed with the rise of computers in
   America in the 1950s. One of the best historical examples of
   computerised control of lights was in Denver, Colorado in 1952. In
   1967, Toronto, Canada was the first to use more advanced computers that
   were better at vehicle detection.^[7] The computers maintained control

   Horizontally-mounted signals in Japan

   A set of lights, known as a signal head,^[21]^: 3.2.4  may have one,
   two, three, or more aspects. The most common signal type has three
   aspects facing the oncoming traffic: red on top, amber (yellow) below,
--
   provides international standards for the setup of traffic signal
   operations. Not all states have ratified the convention. A three-colour
   signal head should have three non-flashing lights which are red, amber,
   and green, arranged either horizontally (on the side opposite to the
   direction of traffic)^[clarification needed] or vertically (with red on
   top). A two-colour signal head may be used in temporary operation and
   consists of red and green non-flashing lights. In both cases, all
   lights should be circular or arrow-shaped.^[4] Permissible signals for
   regulating vehicle traffic (other than public transport vehicles) are
   outlined in Article 23:^[4]

   CAPTION: Standard meanings for traffic lights internationally (Vienna
   Convention, Article 23)

   Light type Meaning
   Non-flashing Red Traffic may not proceed beyond the stop line, or
   otherwise enter the intersection.
   Red/Amber The signal is about to change, but the red light rule
   continues to apply.
   Amber Traffic may not pass the stop line or enter the intersection,
   unless it cannot safely stop when the light shows.
   Green Traffic may proceed, unless it would not clear the intersection
   before the next change of phase.
--

   Green arrows are added to signals to indicate that traffic can proceed
   in a particular direction while the main lights for that approach are
   red, or that traffic can only proceed in one particular direction.
   Alternatively, when combined with another green signal, they may

   turn").^[citation needed] An 'indicative arrow' may be displayed
   alongside a green light. This indicates to drivers that oncoming
   traffic is stopped, such that they do not need to give way to that
   traffic when turning across it. As right-turning traffic (left-side

   Some variations of this setup exist. One version is a horizontal bar
   with five lights – the green and amber arrows are located between the
   standard green and amber lights. A vertical five-light bar holds the
   arrows underneath the standard green light. In this arrangement, the
   amber arrow is sometimes omitted, leaving only the green arrow below
   the steady green light, or possibly an LED-based device capable of
   showing both green and amber arrows within a single lamp housing.^[23]

   A third type is known as a "doghouse" or "cluster head" – a vertical
   column with the two normal lights is on the right side of the signal, a
   vertical column with the two arrows is located on the left, and the
   normal red signal is in the middle above the two columns. Cluster
   signals in Australia and New Zealand use six signals, the sixth being a
   red arrow that can operate separately from the standard red
   light.^[citation needed]

Countdown lights

   [edit]

   Popular in Vietnam and China, countdown lights are additional lights
   installed next to, or above or below, the main signal lights. The
   countdown light is displayed by a countdown number with different
   colours, usually red, yellow, green, matching the colour of the light
   on. When the light counts to "0" (or 1), the main light colour
   immediately changes.

   Countdown lights may have zeros in the tens or none, some countdown
   lights may flash when getting ready to zero. Yellow lights can have
   countdown lights, but most lights do not. Usually the countdown light
   has 2 digits, in case the time of the main light (usually the red
   light, rarely the green light) is longer than 100 seconds, depending on
   the type of light, the following possibilities may occur:
    1. Lights have not counted down, when 99 seconds are left, start
       counting. During the standby time, the light may be displayed as
       "99", "00", "--" or not displayed.
    2. Last 2 digits count light of the timeout (the counter light is 15
       while the time is 115 seconds, there are some types of lights that
       count as "-9" or "9-" when the time is 109 seconds)
    3. Tens digit on the displayer becomes a letter. Displaying A0 for 100

Issue about yellow light dilemma zone in South Korea

   [edit]

   In South Korea, the yellow (amber) light dilemma zone is not legally
   recognised. In other words, when the amber light is on, traffic may not
   pass the stop line or enter the intersection, even if the traffic
   cannot safely stop when the light shows.

   In May 2024, this was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of Korea

   green "go" signals are referred to as 青 (ao), typically translated as

   result, Japanese officials decreed in 1973 that the "go" light should
   be changed to the bluest possible shade of green, bringing the name
   more in line with the colour without violating the international "green
   means go" rule.^[41]

   In the UK, normal traffic lights follow this sequence:^[42]
     * Red – Stop, do not proceed.
     * Red and amber – Get ready to proceed, but do not proceed yet.
--
     * Amber – Stop, unless it is unsafe to do so.

   A speed sign is a special traffic light, variable traffic sign, or
   variable-message sign giving drivers a recommended speed to approach
   the next traffic light in its green phase^[43] and avoid a stop due to
   reaching the intersection when lights are red.^[44]^[a]

Pedestrian signals
--

   Pedestrian signals are used to inform pedestrians when to cross a road.
   Most pedestrian signal heads will have two lights: a 'walk' light
   (normally a walking human figure, typically coloured green or white)
   and a 'don't walk' light (normally either a red or orange man figure or
   a hand), though other variations exist.^[45]

   indication, the intersection is closed to vehicular traffic and

Auditory and tactile signals
--
   [edit]

   In some jurisdictions such as Australia, pedestrian lights are
   associated with a sound device, for the benefit of blind and visually
   impaired pedestrians. These make a slow beeping sound when the
   pedestrian lights are red and a continuous buzzing or fast beeping
   sound when the lights are green. In the Australian States of
   Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia, the sound
   is produced in the same unit as the push buttons. In a circle above the
--

   In some states in the United States, at some busy intersections,
   buttons will make a beeping sound for blind people. When the light
   changes, a speaker built into the button will play a recording to
   notify blind people that it is safe to cross. When the signal flashes
   red, the recording will start to count down with the countdown timer.
   In several countries such as New Zealand, technology also allows deaf
   and blind people to feel when lights have changed to allow safe
   crossing. A small pad, housed within an indentation in the base of the
   box housing the button mechanism, moves downwards when the lights
   change to allow crossing. This is designed to be felt by anyone waiting
   to cross who has limited ability to detect sight or sound.

   In Japan, a traffic light emits an electronic sound that mimics the
   sound of birdsong to help the visually impaired. Some traffic lights
   fix the order and type of sound so that they can tell which direction
   is a green light. In general, "Piyo" (peep) and "Piyo-piyo", which is a
   small bird call, and "Kakkō" and "Ka-kakkō", which is a cuckoo call,
   are associated with this system.^[59] Some pedestrian crossings in
   Lithuania make a slow beeping sound indicating that the traffic light
   is about to turn off.

   direction of the tracks. In Australia and New Zealand, a white "B" or

   apparatus, ambulances, and police cars.^[67]^[68] Most of the systems
   operate with small transmitters that send radio waves, infrared
   signals, or strobe light signals that are received by a sensor on or
   near the traffic lights. Some systems use audio detection, where a
   certain type of siren must be used and detected by a receiver on the
   traffic light structure.

   Upon activation, the normal traffic light cycle is suspended and
   replaced by the "preemption sequence": the traffic lights to all
   approaches to the intersection are switched to "red" with the exception
   of the light for the vehicle that has triggered the preemption
   sequence. Sometimes, an additional signal light is placed nearby to
   indicate to the preempting vehicle that the preempting sequence has
   been activated and to warn other motorists of the approach of an
   emergency vehicle. The normal traffic light cycle resumes after the
   sensor has been passed by the vehicle that triggered the preemption.

   In lieu of preemptive mechanisms, in most jurisdictions, emergency
   vehicles are not required to respect traffic lights. Emergency vehicles
   must slow down, proceed cautiously and activate their emergency lights
   to alert oncoming drivers to the preemption when crossing an
   intersection against the light.^[69]^[70]

   rules. In most jurisdictions, it is against the law to disobey traffic
   signals and the police, or devices such as red light cameras, can issue
   fines or other penalties – and in some cases prosecute – drivers who
   break those laws.^[81] US-based studies have found that the majority of
   drivers think that it is dangerous to run a red light at speed and the
   most common reason for red light running include inattentive driving,
   following an oversized vehicle or during inclement weather.^[82]^[83]

   The rules governing traffic light junctions for vehicles differ by
   jurisdiction. For example, it is common in North America that drivers
   can turn kerb-to-kerb (i.e. turning right at most junctions), even when
   a red light shows.^[84]^[85] This turn on red rule is uncommon in
   Europe, unless an arrow signal or traffic sign specifically permits
   it.^[86]^[87]^[88]^[89]

   [edit]

   Conventional traffic signal lighting, still common in some areas, uses
   a standard light bulb. The light then bounces off a mirrored glass or
   polished aluminium reflector bowl, and out through a polycarbonate
   plastic or glass signal lens. In some signals, these lenses were cut to
   include a specific refracting pattern. Traditionally, incandescent and
   halogen bulbs were used. Because of the low efficiency of light output
   and a single point of failure (filament burnout), some traffic
   authorities are choosing to retrofit traffic signals with LED arrays
   that consume less power, have increased light output, and last
   significantly longer.^[citation needed]

   In the event of an individual LED failure, the aspect will still
   operate albeit with a reduced light output. The light pattern of an LED
   array can be comparable to the pattern of an incandescent or halogen
   bulb fitted with a prismatic lens.

   The low energy consumption of LED lights can pose a driving risk in
   some areas during winter. Unlike incandescent and halogen bulbs, which
   generally get hot enough to melt away any snow that may settle on
   individual lights, LED displays – using only a fraction of the energy –
   remain too cool for this to happen.^[90]^[91] As a response to the
   safety concerns, a heating element on the lens was developed.^[92]^[93]

   Signals such as the 3M High Visibility Signal utilise light-diffusing
   optics and a Fresnel lens to create the signal indication. The light
   from a 150 W PAR46 sealed-beam lamp in these "programmable visibility"
   signals passes through a set of two glass lenses at the back of the
   signal. The first lens, a frosted glass diffusing lens, diffuses the
   light into a uniform ball of light around five inches in diameter. The
   light then passes through a nearly identical lens known as an optical
   limiter (3M's definition of the lens itself), also known as a
   "programming lens", also five inches in diameter.^[citation needed]

   chromaticity and luminance standards. The Fresnel lens collimates the
   light output created by the lamp and creates a uniform display of light
   for the lane in which it is intended.

   In addition to being positioned and mounted for desired visibility for
   their respective traffic, some traffic lights are also aimed, louvered,
   or shaded to minimise misinterpretation from other lanes. For example,
   a Fresnel lens on an adjacent through-lane signal may be aimed to
   prevent left-turning traffic from anticipating its own green arrow.

   software-controlled LED array and electronics to steer the light beam

   interface kit, or wirelessly with a radio kit over WIFI to the signal.
   In addition to aiming, Fresnel lenses, and louvers, visors and back
   panels are also useful in areas where sunlight would diminish the
   contrast and visibility of a signal face. Typical applications for
   these signals were skewed intersections, specific multi-lane control,
   left-turn pocket signals, or other areas where complex traffic
   situations existed.

   [edit]

   In the United States, traffic lights are currently designed with lights
   approximately 12 inches (300 mm) in diameter. Previously the standard
   had been 8 inches (200 mm); however, those are slowly being phased out
   in favour of the larger and more visible 12 inch lights. Variations
   used have also included a hybrid design, which had one or more 12 inch
   lights along with one or more lights of 8 inches (200 mm) on the same
   light.

   In the United Kingdom, 12-inch lights were implemented only with Mellor
   Design Signal heads designed by David Mellor. These were designed for
   symbolic optics to compensate for the light loss caused by the symbol.
   Following a study sponsored by the UK Highways Agency and completed by
   Aston University, Birmingham, UK, an enhanced optical design was
   introduced in the mid-1990s.

   Criticism^[by whom?] of sunlight washout (cannot see the illuminated
   signal due to sunlight falling on it), and sun-phantom (signal
   appearing to be illuminated even when not due to sunlight reflecting
   from the parabolic mirror at low sun angles), led to the design of a
   signal that used lenslets to focus light from a traditional
   incandescent bulb through apertures in a matt black front mask. This
   cured both problems in an easily manufactured solution. This design
--
   Highways Agency, with Dr. Aston engineering a unique solution for each
   manufacturer. Producing both bulb and LED versions of the signal
   aspects, these signals are still the most common type of traffic light
   on UK roads. With the invention of anti-phantom, highly visible Aston
   lenses, lights of 8 inches (200 mm) could be designed to give the same
   output as plain lenses, so a larger surface area was unnecessary.
   Consequently, lights of 12 inches (300 mm) are no longer approved for
   use in the UK and all lights installed on new installations have to be
   200 mm (8 in) in accordance with TSRGD (Traffic Signs Regulations and
   General Directions). Exemptions are made for temporary or replacement

   signals are normally located farside, though in some states, nearside
   signals are also used. Nearside signals can be beneficial to road
   safety, as drivers have more time to see a red light and are less
   likely to encroach on pedestrian crossings.^[98]

--

   Drivers spend on average around 2% of journey time passing through
   signalised junctions.^[99] Traffic lights can increase the traffic
   capacity at intersections and reduce delay for side road traffic, but
   can also result in increased delay for main road traffic.^[100] Hans
   Monderman, the innovative Dutch traffic engineer, and pioneer of shared
   space schemes, was sceptical of their role, and is quoted as having
   said of them: "We only want traffic lights where they are useful and I
   haven't found anywhere where they are useful yet."^[101]

   A World Economic Forum study found that signalised junctions are linked
   to higher rates of localised air pollution. Drivers accelerate and stop
   frequently at lights and as such peak particle concentration can be
   around 29 times higher than during free-flow conditions. The WEF
   recommends that traffic authorities synchronise traffic signals,
   consider alternative traffic management systems and consider placing
   traffic lights away from residential areas, schools, and
   hospitals.^[99]

   By 1992, over 800 traffic lights had been removed at 426 intersections,
   and the number of crashes at these intersections dropped by 60%.^[103]

   Criteria have been developed to help ensure that new traffic lights are
   installed only where they will do more good than harm and to justify
   the removal of existing traffic lights where they are not warranted.
   They are most often placed on arterial roads at intersections with
   either another arterial road or a collector road, or on an expressway

   Additionally, the standard recommended a few situations, such as
   intersections within a coordinated light control systems, where signals
   may be placed.^[106]

   The symbolism of a traffic light (and the meanings of the three primary
   colours used in traffic lights) are frequently found in many other
   contexts. Since they are often used as single spots of colour without
   the context of vertical position, they are typically not comprehensible
   to up to one in ten males who are colour blind.^[citation needed]

   Traffic lights have also been used in computer software, such as the
   macOS user interface, and in pieces of artwork, particularly Traffic
   Light Tree in London, UK.

Racing

   Scuderia Ferrari, a Formula One racing team, formerly used a traffic
   light system during their pit stops to signal to their drivers when to
   leave the pits.^[citation needed] The red light was on when the tires
   were being changed and fuel was being added, amber was on when the
   tires were changed, and green was on when all work was completed. The

   Usually, the system was automatic, but heavy traffic in the pit lane
   forced the team to operate it manually. A mechanic accidentally pressed
   the green light button when the fuel hose was still attached to the
   car, causing Massa to drive off, towing the fuel hose along.
   Additionally, Massa drove into the path of Adrian Sutil, earning him a

   remainder of the 2008 season.

   Another type of traffic light that is used in racing is the Christmas
   Tree, which is used in drag racing. The Christmas Tree has six lights:
   a blue staging light, three amber lights, a green light, and a red
   light. The blue staging light is divided into two parts: Pre-stage and
   stage. Sometimes, there are two sets of bulbs on top of each other to
   represent them. Once a driver is staged at the starting line, then the
   starter will activate the light to commence racing, which can be done
   in two ways. If a Pro tree is used, then the three amber lights will
   flash at the same time. For the Sportsman tree, the amber light will
   flash from top to bottom. When the green light comes up, the race
   officially begins but if a driver crosses the line before that happens,
   then a red light will come up and that will be a foul. ^[citation

       Čapek which debuted in England in 1923 and introduced the term
       'robot' to an English audience. For a short time in England it was
       fashionable to use 'robot' for 'traffic light' from the late 1920s,
       when traffic lights were being installed in England. This usage
       travelled to South Africa in the early 1930s, when they had their
       first traffic lights installed, and where it continues to be used
       almost 90 years later, while 'robot' for 'traffic light' fell out
       of usage in England. See Foster, B. 1970. The changing English
