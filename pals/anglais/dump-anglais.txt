We
use
light
time
to
measure
the
vast
distances
of
space
It
s
the
distance
that
light
travels
in
a
specific
period
of
time
Also
LIGHT

nothing
travels
faster
than
light
How

can
light
travel
in

miles
It
takes
minutes
for
sunlight
to
reach
Jupiter
about
million
miles
away
Light
is
fast
but
the
distances
are
vast
In
an
hour
light

travel

Earth
is
about
eight
light
minutes
from
the
Sun
A
trip
at
light
speed
to
the
very
edge
of
our
solar
system
the
farthest
reaches
of
the
Oort
Cloud
a
collection
of
dormant
comets
way
way
out
there
would
take
about
years
Keep
going
to
Proxima
Centauri
our
nearest
neighboring
star
and
plan
on
arriving
in
years
at
light
speed
When
we
talk
about
the
enormity
of
the
cosmos
it
s
easy
to
toss
out
big
numbers
but
far
more
difficult
to
wrap
our
minds
around
just
how
large
how
far
and
how
numerous
celestial
bodies
really
are
To
get
a
better
sense
for
instance
of
the
true
distances
to
exoplanets
planets
around
other
stars
we
might
start
with
the
theater
in
which
we
find
them
the
Milky
Way
galaxy
Our
galaxy
is
a
gravitationally
bound
collection
of
stars
swirling
in
a
spiral
through
space
Based
on
the
deepest
images
obtained
so
far
it
s
one
of
about
trillion
galaxies
in
the
observable
universe
Groups
of
them
are
bound
into
clusters
of
galaxies
and
these
into
superclusters
the
superclusters
are
arranged
in
immense
sheets
stretching
across
the
universe
interspersed
with
dark
voids
and
lending
the
whole
a
kind
of
spiderweb
structure
Our
galaxy
probably
contains
to
billion
stars
and
is
about
light
years
across
That
sounds
huge
and
it
is
at
least
until
we
start
comparing
it
to
other
galaxies
Our
neighboring
Andromeda
galaxy
for
example
is
some
light
years
wide
Another
galaxy
IC
spans
as
much
as
million
light
years
Based
on
observations
by
NASA
s
Kepler
Space
Telescope
we
can
confidently
predict
that
every
star
you
see
in
the
sky
probably
hosts
at
least
one
planet
Realistically
we
re
most
likely
talking
about
multi
planet
systems
rather
than
just
single
planets
In
our
galaxy
of
hundreds
of
billions
of
stars
this
pushes
the
number
of
planets
potentially
into
the
trillions
Confirmed
exoplanet
detections
made
by
Kepler
and
other
telescopes
both
in
space
and
on
the
ground
now
come
to
more
than
and
that
s
from
looking
at
only
tiny
slices
of
our
galaxy
Many
of
these
are
small
rocky
worlds
that
might
be
at
the
right
temperature
for
liquid
water
to
pool
on
their
surfaces
The
nearest
known
exoplanet
is
a
small
probably
rocky
planet
orbiting
Proxima
Centauri
the
next
star
over
from
Earth
A
little
more
than
four
light
years
away
or
trillion
miles
If
an
airline
offered
a
flight
there
by
jet
it
would
take
million
years
Not
much
is
known
about
this
world
its
close
orbit
and
the
periodic
flaring
of
its
star
lower
its
chances
of
being
habitable
The
TRAPPIST
system
is
seven
planets
all
roughly
in
Earth
s
size
range
orbiting
a
red
dwarf
star
about
light
years
away
They
are
very
likely
rocky
with
four
in
the
habitable
zone
the
orbital
distance
allowing
potential
liquid
water
on
the
surface
And
computer
modeling
shows
some
have
a
good
chance
of
being
watery
or
icy
worlds
In
the
next
few
years
we
might
learn
whether
they
have
atmospheres
or
oceans
or
even
signs
of
habitability
One
of
the
most
distant
exoplanets
known
to
us
in
the
Milky
Way
is
Kepler

Traveling

The
Astronomer
s
Unit
for
Measuring
Distance
In
astronomy
distances
between
celestial
objects
like
stars
and
galaxies
are
very
large
For
example
the
distance
that
separates
us
from
out
closest
neighbour
the
Moon
is
on
average
kilometres
The
Sun
on
the
otherhand
is
on
average
million
kilometres
away
and
the
next
closest
star
is
Proxima
Centauri
at
billion
kilometres
To
avoid
manipulating
such
long
numbers
on
a
regular
basis
a
unit
of
distance
better
adapted
to
the
scale
of
the
Universe
quickly
became
a
necessity
One
unit
of
distance
commonly
used
in
astronomy
is
the
light
year
A
light
year
is
the
distance
travelled
by
light
in
one
year
which
is
trillion
billion
million
thousand
and
kilometres
In
other
words
almost
billion
kilometres
The
creation
of
this
unit
of
distance
was
not
accomplished
overnight
It
was
first
necessary
to
determine
the
speed
of
light
in
order
to
know
the
distance
that
it
will
travel
in
one
year
Before
most
scientists
thought
that
light
moved
instantaneously
from
one
point
to
another
In
that
year
however
the
Danish
physicist
Ole
Christensen
R
mer
was
the
first
to
demonstrate
that
light
had
a
finite
speed
Painted
portrait
of
a
man
with
a
full
head
of
very
long
curly
hair
and
a
mantle
of
red
fabric
draped
over
his
brown
suit
Photo
of
a
planet
featuring
diagonal
grey
white
and
yellow
lines
surrounded
by
two
luminous
dots
below
and
to
the
right
against
a
very
black
background
In
R
mer
began
to
observe
the
satellites
of
Jupiter
and
decided
to
measure
the
time
it
took
for
one
of
the
moons
particularly
Io
to
disappear
behind
the
giant
planet
and
reappear
on
the
other
side
By
accumulating
data
for
many
years
he
determined
that
the
time
separating
the
eclipses
was
shorter
when
the
Earth
was
closer
to
Jupiter
and
longer
when
it
was
at
a
greater
distance
In
the
French
astronomer
Jean
Dominique
Cassini
for
whom
R
mer
was
an
assistant
proposed
that
the
difference
was
due
to
the
time
it
took
light
to
travel
from
Jupiter
to
Earth
However
he
quickly
changed
his
mind
and
abandoned
the
hypothesis
R
mer
on
the
other
hand
continued
to
pursue
the
idea
and
estimated
that
light
takes
minutes
to
travel
a
distance
equal
to
the
diameter
of
the
Earth
s
orbit
we
know
today
that
the
true
value
is
closer
to
minutes
and
seconds
If
R
mer
had
calculated
the
speed
of
light
using
his
data
he
would
have
come
up
with
an
answer
of
kilometres
per
second
which
is
about
half
the
accepted
value
today
of
kilometres
per
second
The
main
source
of
error
would
have
been
the
diameter
of
Earth
s
orbit
which
was
not
well
known
at
the
time
If
the
orbital
diameter
of
the
Earth
as
we
know
it
today
is
combined
with
R
mer
s
data
the
answer
would
be
kilometres
per
second
much
closer
to
the
currently
accepted
speed
It
was
only
in
that
the
majority
of
the
astronomical
community
were
finally
convinced
that
light
had
finite
speed
The
British
astronomer
James
Bradley
published
a
study
demonstrating
that
the
annual
variation
observed
in
the
position
of
the
stars
is
related
to
the
speed
of
light
He
estimated
that
light
travels
at
kilometres
per
second
which
is
very
close
to
the
accepted
value
In
the
German
astronomer
Friedrich
Wilhelm
Bessel
and
not
the
Scottish
astronomer
Thomas
Henderson
as
is
often
mentioned
was
the
first
to
use
the
light
year
as
a
unit
of
measurement
in
astronomy
He
measured
the
distance
separating
us
from
the
binary
star
Cygni
as
light
years
The
advantage
of
the
light
year
as
a
unit
of
measurement
is
not
only
that
it
quantifies
distance
but
that
it
also
provides
the
time
it
takes
for
light
to
reach
Earth
For
example
if
Cygni
is
light
years
from
Earth
kilometres
then
it
takes
it
s
light
years
to
reach
us
We
are
therefore
always
seeing
Cygni
as
it
was
more
than
years
ago
This
is
how
light
allows
us
to
see
into
the
past
and
why
a
telescope
is
really
a
type
of
time
travel
machine
This
concept
applies
equally
to
very
distant
galaxies
that
are
measured
at
distances
of
to
billion
light
years
they
appear
to
us
now
the
way
they
existed
to
billion
years
ago

The
light
year
represents
the
distance
it
takes
for
light
to
travel
in
a
vacuum
during
one
year
We
know
that
the
speed
of
light
is
times
centimetres
per
second
We
must
therefore
multiply
this
by
the
number
of
seconds
in
a
year
about
million
seconds
to
find
the
distance
travelled
by
this
light
the
distance
of
a
light
year
In
professional
astronomy
we
prefer
to
use
another
unit
called
the
parsec
which
is
equal
to
light
years
Professional
astronomers
will
speak
of
the
parsec
the
kiolparsec
and
the
megaparsec
more
than
they
do
of
light
years
but
think
of
it
as
a
unit
of
length
that
gives
us
a
typical
scale
for
the
distance
between
stars
Light
years
Activity

A
new
study
showed
a
surge
of
brain
activity
associated
with
consciousness
among
comatose
patients
who
died
after
cardiac
arrest
The
activity
was
found
in
the
part
of
the
brain
linked
to
dreaming
visual
hallucinations
in
epilepsy
and
altered
states
of
consciousness
Overall
further
research
is
needed
to
better
understand
more
about
what
happens
in
the
dying
brain
There
have
been
many
theories
and
questions
that
go
unanswered
regarding
what
happens
when
a
person
dies
Some
people
who
have
had
near
death
experiences
reported
seeing
a
white
light
while
others
have
said
they
floated

their
bodies

New
research
uncovered
interesting
brain
wave
patterns
in
comatose
patients
who
died
after
cardiac
arrest
The
study
published
this
week
in
the
Proceedings
of
the
National
Academy
of
Science
showed
a
surge
of
conscious
like
activity
in
the
dying
brain
Understanding
why
the
brain
is
activated
during
the
dying
process
Researchers
examined
four
patients
under
EEG
monitoring
who
passed
away
due
to
cardiac
arrest
Since
the
patients
were
unresponsive
comatose
and
couldn
t
receive
any
further
medical
help
they
were
taken
off
life
support
After
being
taken
off
the
ventilator
two
patients
showed
an
increase
in
heart
rate
and
a
surge
of
gamma
wave
activity
in
the
brain
which
is
the
fastest
type
of
activity
and
is
also
correlated
with
consciousness
Additionally
the
activity
was
found
in
the
part
of
the
brain
associated
with
dreaming
visual
hallucinations
in
epilepsy
and
altered
states
of
consciousness
Jimo
Borjigin
Ph
D
associate
professor
in
the
Department
of
Molecular
Integrative
Physiology
and
the
Department
of
Neurology
at
the
University
of
Michigan
and
one
of
the
authors
of
the
study
explained
the
main
takeaways
of
the
reserach
First
the
brain
can
be
activated
by
the
dying
process
Borjigin
told
Healthline
Second
we
need
to
investigate
the
role
of
the
brain
in
cardiac
arrest
if
the
brain
is
more
activated
during
dying
why
There
are
functions
of
the
brain
we
did
not
know
prior
to
our
study
Trying
to
understand
what
happens
as
we
die
We
don
t
fully
know
the
answer
to
this
question
said
Dr
Andrew
Newberg
neuroscientist
and
director
of
research
at
the
Marcus
Institute
of
Integrative
Health
and
a
physician
at
Jefferson
University
Hospital
Previously
it
was
assumed
that
the
brain
just
stops
functioning
but
this
study
and
several
other
similar
ones
are
suggesting
that
there
is
specific
brain
activity
associated
with
the
near
death
state
The
study
found
that
areas
of
the
brain
associated
with
cognitive
processes
including
the
temporo
parietal
junction
and
the
prefrontal
cortex
were
involved
Newberg
added
that
these
areas
of
the
brain
have
been
associated
with
spiritual
experiences
and
that
these
experiences
are
associated
with
an
increased
activity
in
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
which
controls
the
fight
or
flight
response
in
the
body
Do
people
see
a
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
What
this
study
really
suggests
is
that
the
brain
is
undergoing
some
chemical
changes
during
the
dying
process
It
explains
the
perceptions
people
have
about
seeing
angels
or
light
at
the
end
of
a
tunnel
Arthur
Caplan
a
bioethicist
at
NYU
Langone
Medical
Center
stated
What
it
shows
is
that
the
brain
has
measures
that
it
takes
to
try
and
wake
itself
up
and
fires
off
in
ways
that
can
be
hallucinatory
Many
people
are
curious
about
what
happens
next
after
death
but
this
study
is
very
preliminary
and
doesn
t
go
down
that
road
In
some
ways
this
study
sheds
light
on
people
s
fear
that
maybe
they
re
going
to
suffer
when
they
re
dying
at
the
last
moment
and
that
doesn
t
seem
to
be
the
case
But
maybe
they
ll
be
disappointed
because
what
this
study
is
suggesting
is
you
don
t
get
any
insights
from
the
dying
experience
into
what
really
comes
next
Caplan
added
Takeaway
According
to
a
new
study
a
surge
of
conscious
like
brain
activity
occurred
among
comatose
patients
who
died
after
cardiac
arrest
The
activity
was
found
in
the
part
of
the
brain
associated
with
dreaming
visual
hallucinations
in
epilepsy
and
altered
states
of
consciousness
Experts
are
hopeful
that
continuing
with
this
line
of
study
and
learning
more
about
the
dying
brain
could
save
cardiac
arrest
patients
in
the
future

Light
visible
light
or
visible
radiation
is
electromagnetic
radiation
that
can
be
perceived
by
the
human
eye
Visible
light
spans
the
visible
spectrum
and
is
usually
defined
as
having
wavelengths
in
the
range
of
nanometres
nm
corresponding
to
frequencies
of
terahertz
The
visible
band
sits
adjacent
to
the
infrared
with
longer
wavelengths
and
lower
frequencies
and
the
ultraviolet
with
shorter
wavelengths
and
higher
frequencies
called
collectively
optical
radiation
In
physics
the
term
light
may
refer
more
broadly
to
electromagnetic
radiation
of
any
wavelength
whether
visible
or
not
In
this
sense
gamma
rays
X
rays
microwaves
and
radio
waves
are
also
light
This
is
why
visible
radiation
is
commonly
termed
visible
light
The
primary
properties
of
light
are
intensity
propagation
direction
frequency
or
wavelength
spectrum
and
polarization
Its
speed
in
vacuum
m
s
is
one
of
the
fundamental
constants
of
nature
All
electromagnetic
radiation
exhibits
some
properties
of
both
particles
and
waves
Single
massless
elementary
particles
or
quanta
of
light
called
photons
can
be
detected
with
specialized
equipment
phenomena
like
interference
are
described
by
waves
Most
everyday
interactions
with
light
can
be
understood
using
geometrical
optics
Quantum
optics
is
an
important
research
area
in
modern
physics
The
main
source
of
natural
light
on
Earth
is
the
Sun
Historically
another
important
source
of
light
for
humans
has
been
fire
from
ancient
campfires
to
modern
kerosene
lamps
With
the
development
of
electric
lights
and
power
systems
electric
lighting
has
effectively
replaced
firelight

Electromagnetic
spectrum
Generally
electromagnetic
radiation
EMR
is
classified
by
wavelength
into
radio
waves
microwaves
infrared
the
visible
spectrum
that
we
perceive
as
light
ultraviolet
X
rays
and
gamma
rays
The
designation
radiation
excludes
static
electric
magnetic
and
near
fields
The
behavior
of
EMR
depends
on
its
wavelength
Higher
frequencies
have
shorter
wavelengths
and
lower
frequencies
have
longer
wavelengths
When
EMR
interacts
with
single
atoms
and
molecules
its
behavior
depends
on
the
amount
of
energy
per
quantum
it
carries
EMR
in
the
visible
light
region
consists
of
quanta
called
photons
that
are
at
the
lower
end
of
the
energies
that
are
capable
of
causing
electronic
excitation
within
molecules
which
leads
to
changes
in
the
bonding
or
chemistry
of
the
molecule
At
the
lower
end
of
the
visible
light
spectrum
EMR
becomes
invisible
to
humans
infrared
because
its
photons
no
longer
have
enough
individual
energy
to
cause
a
lasting
molecular
change
a
change
in
conformation
in
the
visual
molecule
retinal
in
the
human
retina
which
change
triggers
the
sensation
of
vision
There
exist
animals
that
are
sensitive
to
various
types
of
infrared
but
not
by
means
of
quantum
absorption
Infrared
sensing
in
snakes
depends
on
a
kind
of
natural
thermal
imaging
in
which
tiny
packets
of
cellular
water
are
raised
in
temperature
by
the
infrared
radiation
EMR
in
this
range
causes
molecular
vibration
and
heating
effects
which
is
how
these
animals
detect
it
Above
the
frequency
range
of
visible
light
ultraviolet
light
becomes
invisible
to
humans
mostly
because
it
is
absorbed
by
the
cornea
with
wavelengths
shorter
than
nm
and
the
internal
lens
at
wavelengths
shorter
than
nm
Furthermore
the
rods
and
cones
located
in
the
retina
of
the
human
eye
cannot
detect
the
very
short
shorter
than
nm
ultraviolet
wavelengths
and
are
in
fact
damaged
by
ultraviolet
Many
animals
with
eyes
that
do
not
require
lenses
such
as
insects
and
shrimp
are
able
to
detect
ultraviolet
by
quantum
photon
absorption
mechanisms
in
much
the
same
chemical
way
that
humans
detect
visible
light
Various
sources
define
visible
light
as
narrowly
as
nm
to
as
broadly
as
nm
Under
ideal
laboratory
conditions
people
can
see
infrared
up
to
at
least
nm
children
and
young
adults
may
perceive
ultraviolet
wavelengths
down
to
about
nm
Plant
growth
is
also
affected
by
the
colour
spectrum
of
light
a
process
known
as
photomorphogenesis

The
speed
of
light
in
vacuum
is
defined
to
be
exactly
m
s
approximately
miles
per
second
The
fixed
value
of
the
speed
of
light
in
SI
units
results
from
the
fact
that
the
metre
is
now
defined
in
terms
of
the
speed
of
light
All
forms
of
electromagnetic
radiation
move
at
exactly
this
same
speed
in
vacuum
Different
physicists
have
attempted
to
measure
the
speed
of
light
throughout
history
Galileo
attempted
to
measure
the
speed
of
light
in
the
seventeenth
century
An
early
experiment
to
measure
the
speed
of
light
was
conducted
by
Ole
R
mer
a
Danish
physicist
in
Using
a
telescope
R
mer
observed
the
motions
of
Jupiter
and
one
of
its
moons
Io
Noting
discrepancies
in
the
apparent
period
of
Io
s
orbit
he
calculated
that
light
takes
about
minutes
to
traverse
the
diameter
of
Earth
s
orbit
However
its
size
was
not
known
at
that
time
If
R
mer
had
known
the
diameter
of
the
Earth
s
orbit
he
would
have
calculated
a
speed
of
m
s
Another
more
accurate
measurement
of
the
speed
of
light
was
performed
in
Europe
by
Hippolyte
Fizeau
in
Fizeau
directed
a
beam
of
light
at
a
mirror
several
kilometers
away
A
rotating
cog
wheel
was
placed
in
the
path
of
the
light
beam
as
it
traveled
from
the
source
to
the
mirror
and
then
returned
to
its
origin
Fizeau
found
that
at
a
certain
rate
of
rotation
the
beam
would
pass
through
one
gap
in
the
wheel
on
the
way
out
and
the
next
gap
on
the
way
back
Knowing
the
distance
to
the
mirror
the
number
of
teeth
on
the
wheel
and
the
rate
of
rotation
Fizeau
was
able
to
calculate
the
speed
of
light
as
m
s
L
on
Foucault
carried
out
an
experiment
which
used
rotating
mirrors
to
obtain
a
value
of
m
s
in
Albert
A
Michelson
conducted
experiments
on
the
speed
of
light
from
until
his
death
in
He
refined
Foucault
s
methods
in
using
improved
rotating
mirrors
to
measure
the
time
it
took
light
to
make
a
round
trip
from
Mount
Wilson
to
Mount
San
Antonio
in
California
The
precise
measurements
yielded
a
speed
of
m
s
The
effective
velocity
of
light
in
various
transparent
substances
containing
ordinary
matter
is
less
than
in
vacuum
For
example
the
speed
of
light
in
water
is
about
of
that
in
vacuum
Two
independent
teams
of
physicists
were
said
to
bring
light
to
a
complete
standstill
by
passing
it
through
a
Bose
Einstein
condensate
of
the
element
rubidium
one
team
at
Harvard
University
and
the
Rowland
Institute
for
Science
in
Cambridge
Massachusetts
and
the
other
at
the
Harvard
Smithsonian
Center
for
Astrophysics
also
in
Cambridge
However
the
popular
description
of
light
being
stopped
in
these
experiments
refers
only
to
light
being
stored
in
the
excited
states
of
atoms
then
re
emitted
at
an
arbitrary
later
time
as
stimulated
by
a
second
laser
pulse
During
the
time
it
had
stopped
it
had
ceased
to
be
light

The
study
of
light
and
the
interaction
of
light
and
matter
is
termed
optics
Optics
has
different
forms
appropriate
to
different
circumstances
Geometrical
optics
appropriate
for
understanding
things
like
eyes
lenses
cameras
fiber
optics
and
mirrors
works
well
when
the
wavelength
of
light
is
small
in
comparison
to
the
objects
it
interacts
with
Physical
optics
incorporates
wave
properties
and
is
needed

diffraction
and
interference
Quantum
optics
applies
when
studying
individual
photons
interacting
with
matter
Surface
scattering
A
transparent
object
allows
light
to
transmit
or
pass
through
Conversely
an
opaque
object
does
not
allow
light
to
transmit
through
and
instead
reflecting
or
absorbing
the
light
it
receives
Most
objects
do
not
reflect
or
transmit
light
specularly
and
to
some
degree
scatters
the
incoming
light
which
is
called
glossiness
Surface
scattering
is
caused
by
the
surface
roughness
of
the
reflecting
surfaces
and
internal
scattering
is
caused
by
the
difference
of
refractive
index
between
the
particles
and
medium
inside
the
object
Like
transparent
objects
translucent
objects
allow
light
to
transmit
through
but
translucent
objects
also
scatter
certain
wavelength
of
light
via
internal
scattering

When

the

changes

remains
constant
If
the
beam
of

is
not
orthogonal
or
rather
normal
to
the

the
change
in

results
in
a
change

This
change

is
known
as
refraction
The

quality
of
lenses

List
of
light
sources
There
are
many
sources
of
light
A
body
at
a
given
temperature
emits
a
characteristic
spectrum
of
black
body
radiation
A
simple
thermal
source
is
sunlight
the
radiation
emitted
by
the
chromosphere
of
the
Sun
at
around
K
C
F
Solar
radiation
peaks
in
the
visible
region
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
when
plotted
in
wavelength
units
and
roughly
of
the
radiation
that
reaches
the
ground
is
visible
Another
example
is
incandescent
light
bulbs
which
emit
only
around
of
their
energy
as
visible
light
and
the
remainder
as
infrared
A
common
thermal
light
source
in
history
is
the
glowing
solid
particles
in
flames
but
these
also
emit
most
of
their
radiation
in
the
infrared
and
only
a
fraction
in
the
visible
spectrum
The
peak
of
the
black
body
spectrum
is
in
the
deep
infrared
at
about
micrometre
wavelength
for
relatively
cool
objects
like
human
beings
As
the
temperature
increases
the
peak
shifts
to
shorter
wavelengths
producing
first
a
red
glow
then
a
white
one
and
finally
a
blue
white
colour
as
the
peak
moves
out
of
the
visible
part
of
the
spectrum
and
into
the
ultraviolet
These
colours
can
be
seen
when
metal
is
heated
to
red
hot
or
white
hot
Blue
white
thermal
emission
is
not
often
seen
except
in
stars
the
commonly
seen
pure
blue
colour
in
a
gas
flame
or
a
welder
s
torch
is
in
fact
due
to
molecular
emission
notably
by
CH
radicals
emitting
a
wavelength
band
around
nm
and
is
not
seen
in
stars
or
pure
thermal
radiation
Atoms
emit
and
absorb
light
at
characteristic
energies
This
produces
emission
lines
in
the
spectrum
of
each
atom
Emission
can
be
spontaneous
as
in
light
emitting
diodes
gas
discharge
lamps
such
as
neon
lamps
and
neon
signs
mercury
vapor
lamps
etc
and
flames
light
from
the
hot
gas
itself
so
for
example
sodium
in
a
gas
flame
emits
characteristic
yellow
light
Emission
can
also
be
stimulated
as
in
a
laser
or
a
microwave
maser
Deceleration
of
a
free
charged
particle
such
as
an
electron
can
produce
visible
radiation
cyclotron
radiation
synchrotron
radiation
and
bremsstrahlung
radiation
are
all
examples
of
this
Particles
moving
through
a
medium
faster
than
the
speed
of
light
in
that
medium
can
produce
visible
Cherenkov
radiation
Certain
chemicals
produce
visible
radiation
by
chemoluminescence
In
living
things
this
process
is
called
bioluminescence
For
example
fireflies
produce
light
by
this
means
and
boats
moving
through
water
can
disturb
plankton
which
produce
a
glowing
wake
Certain
substances
produce
light
when
they
are
illuminated
by
more
energetic
radiation
a
process
known
as
fluorescence
Some
substances
emit
light
slowly
after
excitation
by
more
energetic
radiation
This
is
known
as
phosphorescence
Phosphorescent
materials
can
also
be
excited
by
bombarding
them
with
subatomic
particles
Cathodoluminescence
is
one
example
This
mechanism
is
used
in
cathode

tube
television
sets
and
computer

Measurement
Main
articles
Photometry
optics
and
Radiometry
Light
is
measured
with
two
main
alternative
sets
of
units
radiometry
consists
of
measurements
of
light
power
at
all
wavelengths
while
photometry
measures
light
with
wavelength
weighted
with
respect
to
a
standardized
model
of
human
brightness
perception
Photometry
is
useful
for
example
to
quantify
Illumination
lighting
intended
for
human
use
The
photometry
units
are
different
from
most
systems
of
physical
units
in
that
they
take
into
account
how
the
human
eye
responds
to
light
The
cone
cells
in
the
human
eye
are
of
three
types
which
respond
differently
across
the
visible
spectrum
and
the
cumulative
response
peaks
at
a
wavelength
of
around
nm
Therefore
two
sources
of
light
which
produce
the
same
intensity
W
m
of
visible
light
do
not
necessarily
appear
equally
bright
The
photometry
units
are
designed
to
take
this
into
account
and
therefore
are
a
better
representation
of
how
bright
a
light
appears
to
be
than
raw
intensity
They
relate
to
raw
power
by
a
quantity
called
luminous
efficacy
and
are
used
for
purposes
like
determining
how
to
best
achieve
sufficient
illumination
for
various
tasks
in
indoor
and
outdoor
settings
The
illumination
measured
by
a
photocell
sensor
does
not
necessarily
correspond
to
what
is
perceived
by
the
human
eye
and
without
filters
which
may
be
costly

Light
pressure
Main
article
Radiation
pressure
Light
exerts
physical
pressure
on
objects
in
its
path
a
phenomenon
which
can
be
deduced
by
Maxwell
s
equations
but
can
be
more
easily
explained
by
the
particle
nature
of
light
photons
strike
and
transfer
their
momentum
Light
pressure
is
equal
to
the
power
of
the
light
beam
divided
by
c
the
speed
of
light
Due
to
the
magnitude
of
c
the
effect
of
light
pressure
is
negligible
for
everyday
objects
For
example
a
one
milliwatt
laser
pointer
exerts
a
force
of
about
piconewtons
on
the
object
being
illuminated
thus
one
could
lift
a
U
S
penny
with
laser
pointers
but
doing
so
would
require
about
billion
mW
laser
pointers
However
in
nanometre
scale
applications
such
as
nanoelectromechanical
systems
NEMS
the
effect
of
light
pressure
is
more
significant
and
exploiting
light
pressure
to
drive
NEMS
mechanisms
and
to
flip
nanometre
scale
physical
switches
in
integrated
circuits
is
an
active
area
of
research
At
larger
scales
light
pressure
can
cause
asteroids
to
spin
faster
acting
on
their
irregular
shapes
as
on
the
vanes
of
a
windmill
The
possibility
of
making
solar
sails
that
would
accelerate
spaceships
in
space
is
also
under
investigation
Although
the
motion
of
the
Crookes
radiometer
was
originally
attributed
to
light
pressure
this
interpretation
is
incorrect
the
characteristic
Crookes
rotation
is
the
result
of
a
partial
vacuum
This
should
not
be
confused
with
the
Nichols
radiometer
in
which
the
slight
motion
caused
by
torque
though
not
enough
for
full
rotation
against
friction
is
directly
caused
by
light
pressure
As
a
consequence
of
light
pressure
Einstein
in
predicted
the
existence
of
radiation
friction
which
would
oppose
the
movement
of
matter
He
wrote
radiation
will
exert
pressure
on
both
sides
of
the
plate
The
forces
of
pressure
exerted
on
the
two
sides
are
equal
if
the
plate
is
at
rest
However
if
it
is
in
motion
more
radiation
will
be
reflected
on
the
surface
that
is
ahead
during
the
motion
front
surface
than
on
the
back
surface
The
backwardacting
force
of
pressure
exerted
on
the
front
surface
is
thus
larger
than
the
force
of
pressure
acting
on
the
back
Hence
as
the
resultant
of
the
two
forces
there
remains
a
force
that
counteracts
the
motion
of
the
plate
and
that
increases
with
the
velocity
of
the
plate
We
will
call
this
resultant
radiation
friction
in
brief
Usually
light
momentum
is
aligned
with
its
direction
of
motion
However
for
example
in
evanescent
waves
momentum
is
transverse
to
direction
of
propagation
Historical
theories
about
light
in
chronological
order
Classical
Greece
and
Hellenism
In
the
fifth
century
BC
Empedocles
postulated
that
everything
was
composed
of
four
elements
fire
air
earth
and
water
He
believed
that
goddess
Aphrodite
made
the
human
eye
out
of
the
four
elements
and
that
she
lit
the
fire
in
the
eye
which
shone
out
from
the
eye
making
sight
possible
If
this
were
true
then
one
could
see
during
the
night
just
as
well
as
during
the
day
so
Empedocles
postulated
an
interaction
between
rays
from
the
eyes
and
rays
from
a
source
such
as
the
sun
In
about
BC
Euclid
wrote
Optica
in
which
he
studied
the
properties
of
light
Euclid
postulated
that
light
travelled
in
straight
lines
and
he
described
the
laws
of
reflection
and
studied
them
mathematically
He
questioned
that
sight
is
the
result
of
a
beam
from
the
eye
for
he
asks
how
one
sees
the
stars
immediately
if
one
closes
one
s
eyes
then
opens
them
at
night
If
the
beam
from
the
eye
travels
infinitely
fast
this
is
not
a
problem
In
BC
Lucretius
a
Roman
who
carried
on
the
ideas
of
earlier
Greek
atomists
wrote
that
The
light
heat
of
the
sun
these
are
composed
of
minute
atoms
which
when
they
are
shoved
off
lose
no
time
in
shooting
right
across
the
interspace
of
air
in
the
direction
imparted
by
the
shove
from
On
the
nature
of
the
Universe
Despite
being
similar
to
later
particle
theories
Lucretius
s
views
were
not
generally
accepted
Ptolemy
c
second
century
wrote
about
the
refraction
of
light
in
his
book
Optics
Classical
India
In
ancient
India
the
Hindu
schools
of
Samkhya
and
Vaisheshika
from
around
the
early
centuries
AD
developed
theories
on
light
According
to
the
Samkhya
school
light
is
one
of
the
five
fundamental
subtle
elements
tanmatra
out
of
which
emerge
the
gross
elements
The
atomicity
of
these
elements
is
not
specifically
mentioned
and
it
appears
that
they
were
actually
taken
to
be
continuous
The
Vishnu
Purana
refers
to
sunlight
as
the
seven
rays
of
the
sun
The
Indian
Buddhists
such
as
Dign
ga
in
the
fifth
century
and
Dharmakirti
in
the
seventh
century
developed
a
type
of
atomism
that
is
a
philosophy
about
reality
being
composed
of
atomic
entities
that
are
momentary
flashes
of
light
or
energy
They
viewed
light
as
being
an
atomic
entity
equivalent
to
energy
Descartes
Ren
Descartes
held
that
light
was
a
mechanical
property
of
the
luminous
body
rejecting
the
forms
of
Ibn
al
Haytham
and
Witelo
as
well
as
the
species
of
Roger
Bacon
Robert
Grosseteste
and
Johannes
Kepler
In
he
published
a
theory
of
the
refraction
of
light
that
assumed
incorrectly
that
light
travelled
faster
in
a
denser
medium
than
in
a
less
dense
medium
Descartes
arrived
at
this
conclusion
by
analogy
with
the
behaviour
of
sound
waves
citation

Although
Descartes
was
incorrect
about
the
relative
speeds
he
was
correct
in
assuming
that
light
behaved
like
a
wave
and
in
concluding
that
refraction
could
be
explained
by
the
speed
of
light
in
different
media
Descartes
is
not
the
first
to
use
the
mechanical
analogies
but
because
he
clearly
asserts
that
light
is
only
a
mechanical
property
of
the
luminous
body
and
the
transmitting
medium
Descartes
s
theory
of

Pierre
Gassendi
Pierre
Gassendi
an
atomist
proposed
a
particle
theory
of
light
which
was
published
posthumously
in
the
s
Isaac
Newton
studied
Gassendi
s
work
at
an
early
age
and
preferred
his
view
to
Descartes
s
theory
of
the
plenum
He
stated
in
his
Hypothesis
of
Light
of
that
light
was
composed
of
corpuscles
particles
of
matter
which
were
emitted
in
all
directions
from
a
source
One
of
Newton
s
arguments
against
the
wave
nature
of
light
was
that
waves
were
known
to
bend
around
obstacles
while
light
travelled
only
in
straight
lines
He
did
however
explain
the
phenomenon
of
the
diffraction
of
light
which
had
been
observed
by
Francesco
Grimaldi
by
allowing
that
a
light
particle
could
create
a
localised
wave
in
the
aether
Newton
s
theory
could
be
used
to
predict
the
reflection
of
light
but
could
only
explain
refraction
by
incorrectly
assuming
that
light
accelerated
upon
entering
a
denser
medium
because
the
gravitational
pull
was
greater
Newton
published
the
final
version
of
his
theory
in
his
Opticks
of
His
reputation
helped
the
particle
theory
of
light
to
hold
sway
during
the
eighteenth
century
The
particle
theory
of
light
led
Pierre
Simon
Laplace
to
argue
that
a
body
could
be
so
massive
that
light
could
not
escape
from
it
In
other
words
it
would
become
what
is
now
called
a
black
hole
Laplace
withdrew
his
suggestion
later
after
a
wave
theory
of
light
became
firmly
established
as
the
model
for
light
as
has
been
explained
neither
a
particle
or
wave
theory
is
fully
correct
A
translation
of
Newton
s
essay
on
light
appears
in
The
large
scale
structure
of

time
by
Stephen
Hawking
and
George
F
R
Ellis
The
fact
that
light
could
be
polarized
was
for
the
first
time
qualitatively
explained
by
Newton
using
the
particle
theory
tienne
Louis
Malus
in
created
a
mathematical
particle
theory
of
polarization
Jean
Baptiste
Biot
in
showed
that
this
theory
explained
all
known
phenomena
of
light
polarization
At
that
time
the
polarization
was
considered
as
the
proof
of
the
particle
theory
Wave
theory
To
explain
the
origin
of
colours
Robert
Hooke
developed
a
pulse
theory
and
compared
the
spreading
of
light
to
that
of
waves
in
water
in
his
work
Micrographia
Observation
IX
In
Hooke
suggested
that
light
s
vibrations
could
be
perpendicular
to
the
direction
of
propagation
Christiaan
Huygens
worked
out
a
mathematical
wave
theory
of
light
in
and
published
it
in
his
Treatise
on
Light
in
He
proposed
that
light
was
emitted
in
all
directions
as
a
series
of
waves
in
a
medium
called
the
luminiferous
aether
As
waves
are
not
affected
by
gravity
it
was
assumed
that
they
slowed
down
upon
entering
a
denser
medium
Another
supporter
of
the
wave
theory
was
Leonhard
Euler
He
argued
in
Nova

lucis
et

that

could
more

Thomas
Young
s
sketch
of
water
waves
showing
diffraction
The
wave
theory
predicted
that
light
waves
could
interfere
with
each
other
like
sound
waves
as
noted
around
by
Thomas
Young
Young
showed
by
means
of
numerous
diffraction
experiments
that
light
behaved
as
waves
He
first
publicly
stated
his
general
law
of
interference
in
January
in
his
book
A
Syllabus
of
a
Course
of
Lectures
on
Natural
and
Experimental
Philosophy
But
the
general
law
by
which
all
these
appearances
are
governed
may
be
very
easily
deduced
from
the
interference
of
two
coincident
undulations
which
either
cooperate
or
destroy
each
other
in
the
same
manner
as
two
musical
notes
produce
an
alternate
intension
and
remission
in
the
beating
of
an
imperfect
unison
He
also
proposed
that
different
colours
were
caused
by
different
wavelengths
of
light
and
explained
colour
vision
in
terms
of
three
coloured
receptors
in
the
eye
In
Andr
Marie
Amp
re
gave
Augustin
Jean
Fresnel
an
idea
that
the
polarization
of
light
can
be
explained
by
the
wave
theory
if
light
were
a
transverse
wave
Later
Fresnel
independently
worked
out
his
own
wave
theory
of
light
and
presented
it
to
the
Acad
mie
des
Sciences
in
Sim
on
Denis
Poisson
challenged
Fresnel
s
model
claiming
that
it
predicted
a
bright
spot
in
the
shadow
behind
a
circular
obstacle
contrary
to
common
sense
Dominique
Fran
ois
Jean
Arago
created
an
experiment
that
showed
the
bright
spot
Poisson
s
challenge
became
new
evidence
for
the
wave
theory
In
Young
wrote
to
Arago
suggesting
that
light
must
be
transverse
waves
not
the
longitudinal
waves
characteristic
of
sound
Fresnel
took
up
the
idea
and
was
able
to
show
via
mathematical
methods
that
polarization
could
be
explained
by
a
transverse
wave
theory
of
light
with
no
longitudinal
vibration
The
weakness
of
the
wave
theory
was
that
light
waves
like
sound
waves
would
need
a
medium
for
transmission
The
existence
of
the
hypothetical
substance
luminiferous
aether
proposed
by
Huygens
in
was
cast
into
strong
doubt
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
by
the
Michelson
Morley
experiment
Newton
s
corpuscular
theory
implied
that
light
would
travel
faster
in
a
denser
medium
while
the
wave
theory
of
Huygens
and
others
implied
the
opposite
At
that
time
the
speed
of
light
could
not
be
measured
accurately
enough
to
decide
which
theory
was
correct
The
first
to
make
a
sufficiently
accurate
measurement
was
L
on
Foucault
in
His
result
supported
the
wave
theory
and
the
classical
particle
theory
was
finally
abandoned
only
to
partly
re
emerge
in
the
twentieth
century
as
photons

A
linearly
polarized
electromagnetic
wave
traveling
along
the
z
axis
with
E
denoting
the
electric
field
and
perpendicular
B
denoting
magnetic
field
In
Michael
Faraday
discovered
that
the
plane
of
polarization
of
linearly
polarized
light
is
rotated
when
the
light
rays
travel
along
the
magnetic
field
direction
in
the
presence
of
a
transparent
dielectric
an
effect
now
known
as
Faraday
rotation
This
was
the
first
evidence
that
light
was
related
to
electromagnetism
In
he
speculated
that
light
might
be
some
form
of
disturbance
propagating
along
magnetic
field
lines
Faraday
proposed
in
that
light
was
a
high
frequency
electromagnetic
vibration
which
could
propagate
even
in
the
absence
of
a
medium
such
as
the
ether
Faraday
s
work
inspired
James
Clerk
Maxwell
to
study
electromagnetic
radiation
and
light
Maxwell
discovered
that
self
propagating
electromagnetic
waves
would
travel
through
space
at
a
constant
speed
which
happened
to
be
equal
to
the
previously
measured
speed
of
light
From
this
Maxwell
concluded
that
light
was
a
form
of
electromagnetic
radiation
he
first
stated
this
result
in
in
On
Physical
Lines
of
Force
In
he
published
A
Treatise
on
Electricity
and
Magnetism
which
contained
a
full
mathematical
description
of
the
behavior
of
electric
and
magnetic
fields
still
known
as
Maxwell
s
equations
Soon
after
Heinrich
Hertz
confirmed
Maxwell
s
theory
experimentally
by
generating
and
detecting
radio
waves
in
the
laboratory
and
demonstrating
that
these
waves
behaved
exactly
like
visible
light
exhibiting
properties
such
as
reflection
refraction
diffraction
and
interference
Maxwell
s
theory
and
Hertz
s
experiments
led
directly
to
the
development
of
modern
radio
radar
television
electromagnetic
imaging
and
wireless
communications
In
the
quantum
theory
photons
are
seen
as
wave
packets
of
the
waves
described
in
the
classical
theory
of
Maxwell
The
quantum
theory
was
needed
to
explain
effects
even
with
visual
light
that
Maxwell
s
classical
theory
could
not
such
as
spectral
lines
Quantum
theory
In
Max
Planck
attempting
to
explain
black
body
radiation
suggested
that
although
light
was
a
wave
these
waves
could
gain
or
lose
energy
only
in
finite
amounts
related
to
their
frequency
Planck
called
these
lumps
of
light
energy
quanta
from
a
Latin
word
for
how
much
In
Albert
Einstein
used
the
idea
of
light
quanta
to
explain
the
photoelectric
effect
and
suggested
that
these
light
quanta
had
a
real
existence
In
Arthur
Holly
Compton
showed
that
the
wavelength
shift
seen
when
low
intensity
X
rays
scattered
from
electrons
so
called
Compton
scattering
could
be
explained
by
a
particle
theory
of
X
rays
but
not
a
wave
theory
In
Gilbert
N
Lewis
named
these
light
quanta
particles
photons
Eventually
quantum
mechanics
came
to
picture
light
as
in
some
sense
both
a
particle
and
a
wave
and
in
another
sense
as
a
phenomenon
which
is
neither
a
particle
nor
a
wave
which
actually
are
macroscopic
phenomena
such
as
baseballs
or
ocean
waves
Instead
under
some
approximations
light
can
be
described
sometimes
with
mathematics
appropriate
to
one
type
of
macroscopic
metaphor
particles
and
sometimes
another
macroscopic
metaphor
waves
As
in
the
case
for
radio
waves
and
the
X
rays
involved
in
Compton
scattering
physicists
have
noted
that
electromagnetic
radiation
tends
to
behave
more
like
a
classical
wave
at
lower
frequencies
but
more
like
a
classical
particle
at
higher
frequencies
but
never
completely
loses
all
qualities
of
one
or
the
other
Visible
light
which
occupies
a
middle
ground
in
frequency
can
easily
be
shown
in
experiments
to
be
describable
using
either
a
wave
or
particle
model
or
sometimes
both
In
Satyendra
Nath
Bose
showed
that
light
followed
different
statistics
from
that
of
classical
particles
With
Einstein
they
generalized
this
result
for
a
whole
set
of
integer
spin
particles
called
bosons
after
Bose
that
follow
Bose
Einstein
statistics
The
photon
is
a
massless
boson
of
spin
In
Paul
Dirac
quantized
the
electromagnetic
field
Pascual
Jordan
and
Vladimir
Fock
generalized
this
process
to
treat
many
body
systems
as
excitations
of
quantum
fields
a
process
with
the
misnomer
of
second
quantization
And
at
the
end
of
the
s
a
full
theory
of
quantum
electrodynamics
was
developed
using
quantum
fields
based
on
the
works
of
Julian
Schwinger
Richard
Feynman
Freeman
Dyson
and
Shinichiro
Tomonaga
Quantum

Quantum
optics
John
R
Klauder
George
Sudarshan
Roy
J
Glauber
and
Leonard
Mandel
applied
quantum
theory
to
the
electromagnetic
field
in
the
s
and
s
to
gain
a
more
detailed
understanding
of
photodetection
and
the
statistics
of
light
see
degree
of
coherence
This
led
to
the
introduction
of
the
coherent
state
as
a
concept
which
addressed
variations
between
laser
light
thermal
light
exotic
squeezed
states
etc
as
it
became
understood
that
light
cannot
be
fully
described
just
referring
to
the
electromagnetic
fields
describing
the
waves
in
the
classical
picture
In
H
Jeff
Kimble
et
al
demonstrated
a
single
atom
emitting
one
photon
at
a
time
further
compelling
evidence
that
light
consists
of
photons
Previously
unknown
quantum
states
of
light
with
characteristics
unlike
classical
states
such
as
squeezed
light
were
subsequently
discovered
Development
of
short
and
ultrashort
laser
pulses
created
by
Q
switching
and
modelocking
techniques
opened
the
way
to
the
study
of
what
became
known
as
ultrafast
processes
Applications
for
solid
state
research
e
g
Raman
spectroscopy
were
found
and
mechanical
forces
of
light
on
matter
were
studied
The
latter
led
to
levitating
and
positioning
clouds
of
atoms
or
even
small
biological
samples
in
an
optical
trap
or
optical
tweezers
by
laser
beam
This
along
with
Doppler
cooling
and
Sisyphus
cooling
was
the
crucial
technology
needed
to
achieve
the
celebrated
Bose
Einstein
condensation
Other
remarkable
results
are
the
demonstration
of
quantum
entanglement
quantum
teleportation
and
quantum
logic
gates
The
latter
are
of
much
interest
in
quantum
information
theory
a
subject
which
partly
emerged
from
quantum
optics
partly
from
theoretical
computer
science
Use
for
light
on
Earth
Sunlight
provides
the
energy
that
green
plants
use
to
create
sugars
mostly
in
the
form
of
starches
which
release
energy
into
the
living
things
that
digest
them
This
process
of
photosynthesis
provides
virtually
all
the
energy
used
by
living
things
Some
species
of
animals
generate
their
own
light
a
process
called
bioluminescence
For
example
fireflies
use
light
to
locate
mates
and
vampire
squid
use
it
to
hide
themselves
from
prey

What
is
the
visible
light
spectrum
The
visible
light
spectrum
is
the
segment
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
that
the
human
eye
can
view
More
simply
this
range
of
wavelengths
is
called
visible
light
Typically
the
human
eye
can
detect
wavelengths
from
to
nanometers
WAVELENGTHS
OF
VISIBLE
LIGHT
All
electromagnetic
radiation
is
light
but
we
can
only
see
a
small
portion
of
this
radiation
the
portion
we
call
visible
light
Cone
shaped
cells
in
our
eyes
act
as
receivers
tuned
to
the
wavelengths
in
this
narrow
band
of
the
spectrum
Other
portions
of
the
spectrum
have
wavelengths
too
large
or
too
small
and
energetic
for
the
biological
limitations
of
our
perception
As
the
full
spectrum
of
visible
light
travels
through
a
prism
the
wavelengths
separate
into
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
because
each
color
is
a
different
wavelength
Violet
has
the
shortest
wavelength
at
around
nanometers
and
red
has
the
longest
wavelength
at
around
nanometers

THE
SUN
S
CORONA
The
Sun
is
the
dominant
source
for
visible
light
waves
our
eyes
receive
The
outer
most
layer
of
the
Sun
s
atmosphere
the
corona
can
be
seen
in
visible
light
But
it
is
so
faint
it
cannot
not
be
seen
except
during
a
total
solar
eclipse
because
the
bright
photosphere
overwhelms
it
The
photograph
below
was
taken
during
a
total
eclipse
of
the
Sun
where
the
photosphere
and
chromosphere
are
almost
completely
blocked
by
the
moon
The
tapered
patterns
coronal
streamers
around
the
Sun
are
formed
by
the
outward
flow
of
plasma
that
is
shaped
by
magnetic
field
lines
extending
millions
of
miles
into
space

eclipse

that

the

COLOR
AND
TEMPERATURE
As
objects
grow
hotter
they
radiate
energy
dominated
by
shorter
wavelengths
changing
color
before
our
eyes
A
flame
on
a
blow
torch
shifts
from
reddish
to
bluish
in
color
as
it
is
adjusted
to
burn
hotter
In
the
same
way
the
color
of
stars
tells
scientists
about
their
temperature
Our
Sun
produces
more
yellow
light
than
any
other
color
because
its
surface
temperature
is
C
If
the
Sun
s
surface
were
cooler
say
C
it
would
look
reddish
like
the
star
Betelgeuse
If
the
Sun
were
hotter
say
C
it
would
look
blue
like
the
star
Rigel
Isaac
Newton
s
experiment
in
showed
that
a
prism
bends
visible
light
and
that
each
color
refracts
at
a
slightly
different
angle
depending
on
the
wavelength
of
the
color

SPECTRA
AND
SPECTRAL
SIGNATURES
Close
examination
of
the
visible
light
spectrum
from
our
Sun
and
other
stars
reveals
a
pattern
of
dark
lines
called
absorption
lines
These
patterns
can
provide
important
scientific
clues
that
reveal
hidden
properties
of
objects
throughout
the
universe
Certain
elements
in
the
Sun
s
atmosphere
absorb
certain
colors
of
light
These
patterns
of
lines
within
spectra
act
like
fingerprints
for
atoms
and
molecules
Looking
at
the
Sun
s
spectrum
for
example
the
fingerprints
for
elements
are
clear
to
those
knowledgeable
about
those
patterns
An
image
of
the
full
spectrum
of
visible
light
the
rainbow
with
dark
lines
appearing
in
the
red
orange
yellow
and
green
blue
areas
of
the
spectrum
These
dark
lines
indicate
that
these
specific
wavelengths
are
missing
and
can
be
aligned
to
the
elements
that
absorb
these
specific
wavelengths
hydrogen
sodium
and
magnesium
Patterns
are
also
evident
in
a
graph
of
an
object
s
reflectance
Elements
molecules
and
even
cell
structures
have
unique
signatures
of
reflectance
A
graph
of
an
object
s
reflectance
across
a
spectrum
is
called
a
spectral
signature
Spectral
signatures
of
different
Earth
features
within
the
visible
light
spectrum
ARE
shown
below
A
graph
showing
wavelengths
in
nanometers
on
the
x
axis
and

reflectance

axis
Snow
ice
and
clouds
show
a
high
reflectance
across
all
wavelengths
Dry
soil
wet
soil
turbid
water
and
clear
water
all
seem
to
reflect
similar
values
in
the
blue
and
green
wavelengths
but
have
very
different
value
closer
to
red
and
infrared
where
soils
reflect
more
than
water
Vegetation
reflects
more
in
the
green
and
infrared
than
in
the
blue

enabled
scientists
to
calculate
the

as
well
as
the
top

They
can
also
sense
the
distribution
of

There

Physical
optics
deals
primarily
with
the
nature
and
properties
of
light
itself
Geometrical
optics
has
to
do
with
the
principles
that
govern
the
image
forming
properties
of
lenses
mirrors
and
other
devices
that
make
use
of
light
It
also
includes
optical
data
processing
which
involves
the
manipulation
of
the
information
content
of
an
image
formed
by
coherent
optical
systems
Originally
the
term
optics
was
used
only
in
relation
to
the
eye
and
vision
Later
as
lenses
and
other
devices
for
aiding
vision
began
to
be
developed
these
were
naturally
called
optical
instruments
and
the
meaning
of
the
term
optics
eventually
became
broadened
to
cover
any
application
of
light
even
though
the
ultimate
receiver
is
not
the
eye
but
a
physical
detector
such
as
a
photographic
plate
or
a
television
camera
In
the
th
century
optical
methods
came
to
be
applied
extensively
to
regions
of
the
electromagnetic
radiation
spectrum
not
visible
to
the
eye
such
as
X
rays
ultraviolet
infrared
and
microwave
radio
waves
and
to
this
extent
these
regions
are
now
often
included
in
the
general
field
of
optics

the
present

the

Geometrical
optics
General
considerations
The
optical
image
An
optical
image
may
be
regarded
as
the
apparent
reproduction
of
an
object
by
a
lens
or
mirror
system
employing
light
as
a
carrier
An
entire
image
is
generally
produced
simultaneously
as
by
the
lens
in
a
camera
but
images
may
also
be
generated
sequentially
by
point
by
point
scanning
as
in
a
television
system
or
in
the
radio
transmission
of
pictures
across
long
distances
in
space
Nevertheless
the
final
detector
of
all
images
is
invariably
the
human
eye
and
whatever
means
is
used
to
transmit
and
control
the
light
the
final
image
must
either
be
produced
simultaneously
or
scanned
so
rapidly
that
the
observer
s
persistence
of
vision
will
give
him
the
mental
impression
of
a
complete
image
covering
a
finite
field
of
view
For
this
to
be
effective
the
image
must
be
repeated
as
in
motion
pictures
or
scanned
as
in
television
at
least
times
a
second
to
eliminate
flicker
or
any
appearance
of
intermittency
Historical
background
To
the
ancients
the
processes
of
image
formation
were
full
of
mystery
Indeed
for
a
long
time
there
was
a
great
discussion
as
to
whether
in
vision
something
moved
from
the
object
to
the
eye
or
whether
something
reached
out
from
the
eye
to
the
object
By
the
beginning
of
the
th
century
however
it
was
known
that
rays
of
light
travel
in
straight
lines
and
in
Johannes
Kepler
a
German
astronomer
published
a
book
on
optics
in
which
he
postulated
that
an
extended
object
could
be
regarded
as
a
multitude
of
separate
points
each
point
emitting
rays
of
light
in
all
directions
Some
of
these
rays
would
enter
a
lens
by
which
they
would
be
bent
around
and
made
to
converge
to
a
point
the
image
of
the
object
point
whence
the
rays
originated
The
lens
of
the
eye
was
not
different
from
other
lenses
and
it
formed
an
image
of
external
objects
on
the
retina
producing
the
sensation
of
vision
There
are
two
main
types
of
image
to
be
considered
real
and
virtual
A
real
image
is
formed
outside
the
system
where
the
emerging
rays
actually
cross
such
an
image
can
be
caught
on
a
screen
or
piece
of
film
and
is
the
kind
of
image
formed
by
a
slide
projector
or
in
a
camera
A
virtual
image
on
the
other
hand
is
formed
inside
an
instrument
at
the
point
where
diverging
rays
would
cross
if
they
were
extended
backward
into
the
instrument
Such
an
image
is
formed
in
a
microscope
or
telescope
and
can
be
seen
by
looking
into
the
eyepiece
Kepler
s
concept
of
an
image
as
being
formed
by
the
crossing
of
rays
was
limited
in
that
it
took
no
account
of
possible
unsharpness
caused
by
aberrations
diffraction
or
even
defocussing
In
the
Italian
physicist
Vasco
Ronchi
went
the
other
way
and
defined
an
image
as
any
recognizable
nonuniformity
in
the
light
distribution
over
a
surface
such
as
a
screen
or
film
the
sharper
the
image
the
greater
the
degree
of
nonuniformity
Today
the
concept
of
an
image
often
departs
from
Kepler
s
idea
that
an
extended
object
can
be
regarded
as
innumerable
separate
points
of
light
and
it
is
sometimes
more
convenient
to
regard
an
image
as
being
composed
of
overlapping
patterns
of
varying
frequencies
and
contrasts
hence
the
quality
of
a
lens
can
be
expressed
by
a
graph
connecting
the
spatial
frequency
of
a
parallel
line
object
with
the
contrast
in
the
image

concept

Optics
had
progressed
rapidly
by
the
early
years
of
the
th
century
Lenses
of
moderately
good
quality
were
being
made
for
telescopes
and
microscopes
and
in
the
great
mathematician
Carl
Friedrich
Gauss
published
his
classical
book
on
geometrical
optics
In
it
he
expounded
the
concept
of
the
focal
length
and
cardinal
points
of
a
lens
system
and
developed
formulas
for
calculating
the
position
and
size
of
the
image
formed
by
a
lens
of
given
focal
length
Between
and
Gauss
s
theory
was
extended
to
the
calculation
of
the
five
principal
aberrations
of
a
lens
see
below
Lens
aberrations
thus
laying
the
foundation
for
the
formal
procedures
of
lens
design
that
were
used
for
the
next
years
Since
about
however
lens
design
has
been
almost
entirely
computerized
and
the
old
methods
of
designing
lenses
by
hand
on
a
desk
calculator
are
rapidly
disappearing
By
the
end
of
the
th
century
numerous
other
workers
had
entered
the
field
of
geometrical
optics
notably
an
English
physicist
Lord
Rayleigh
John
William
Strutt
and
a
German
physicist
Ernst
Karl
Abbe
It
is
impossible
to
list
all
their
accomplishments
here
Since
there
has
been
a
great
resurgence
in
optics
on
the
basis
of
information
and
communication
theory
which
is
treated
at
length
below
Light
rays
waves
and
wavelets
A
single
point
of
light
which
may
be
a
point
in
an
extended
object
emits
light
in
the
form
of
a
continually
expanding
train
of
waves
spherical
in
shape
and
centred
about
the
point
of
light
It
is
however
often
much
more
convenient
to
regard
an
object
point
as
emitting
fans
of
rays
the
rays
being
straight
lines
everywhere
perpendicular
to
the
waves
When
the
light
beam
is
refracted
by
a
lens
or
reflected
by
a
mirror
the
curvature
of
the
waves
is
changed
and
the
angular
divergence
of
the
ray
bundle
is
similarly
changed
in
such
a
way
that
the
rays
remain
everywhere
perpendicular
to
the
waves
When
aberrations
are
present
a
convergent
ray
bundle
does
not
shrink
to
a
perfect
point
and
the
emerging
waves
are
then
not
truly
spherical
In
Christiaan
Huygens
a
Dutch
scientist
postulated
that
a
light
wave
progresses
because
each
point
in
it
becomes
the
centre
of
a
little
wavelet
travelling
outward
in
all
directions
at
the
speed
of
light
each
new
wave
being
merely
the
envelope
of
all
these
expanding
wavelets
When
the
wavelets
reach
the
region
outside
the
outermost
rays
of
the
light
beam
they
destroy
each
other
by
mutual
interference
wherever
a
crest
of
one
wavelet
falls
upon
a
trough
of
another
wavelet
Hence
in
effect
no
waves
or
wavelets
are
allowed
to
exist
outside
the
geometrical
light
beam
defined
by
the
rays
The
normal
destruction
of
one
wavelet
by
another
which
serves
to
restrict
the
light
energy
to
the
region
of
the
rectilinear
ray
paths
however
breaks
down
when
the
light
beam
strikes
an
opaque
edge
for
the
edge
then
cuts
off
some
of
the
interfering
wavelets
allowing
others
to
exist
which
diverge
slightly
into
the
shadow
area
This
phenomenon
is
called
diffraction
and
it
gives
rise
to
a
complicated
fine
structure
at
the
edges
of
shadows
and
in
optical
images

An
excellent
example
of
the
working
of
the
wavelet
theory
is
found
in
the
well
known
pinhole
camera
If
the
pinhole
is
large
the
diverging
geometrical
pencil
of
rays
leads
to
a
blurred
image

point
in
the
object

large
pinhole

If
the
pinhole
is
made
extremely
small
however
the
geometrical
patch
then
becomes
small
but
the
diffraction
spreading
is
now
great
leading
once
more
to
a
blurred
picture
There
are
thus
two
opposing
effects
present
and
at
the
optimum
hole
size
the
two
effects
are
just
equal
This
occurs
when
the
hole
diameter
is
equal
to
the
square
root

and
a

would
probably

A
pinhole
like
a
camera
lens
can
be
regarded
as
having
an

which
is
the

of
focal

to

this
example
the

Resolution
and
the
Airy

When
a
well
corrected
lens
is
used
in
place
of
a
pinhole
the
geometrical
ray
divergence
is
eliminated
by
the
focussing
action
of
the
lens
and
a
much
larger
aperture
may
be
employed
in
that
case
the
diffraction
spreading
becomes
small
indeed
The
image
of
a
point
formed
by
a
perfect
lens
is
a
minute
pattern
of
concentric
and
progressively
fainter
rings
of
light
surrounding
a
central
dot
the
whole
structure
being
called
the
Airy
disk
after
George
Biddell
Airy
an
English
astronomer
who
first
explained
the
phenomenon
in
The
Airy
disk
of
a
practical
lens
is
small
its
diameter
being
approximately
equal
to
the
f
number
of
the
lens
expressed
in
microns
millimetre
The
Airy
disk
of
an
f
lens
is
therefore
about
millimetre
in
diameter
ten
times
the
wavelength
of
blue
light
Nevertheless
the
Airy
disk
formed
by
a
telescope
or
microscope
objective
can
be
readily
seen
with
a
bright
point
source
of
light
if
a
sufficiently
high
eyepiece
magnification
is
used
The
finite
size
of
the
Airy
disk
sets
an
inevitable
limit
to
the
possible
resolving
power
of
a
visual
instrument
Rayleigh
found
that
two
adjacent
and
equally
bright
stars
can
just
be
resolved
if
the
image
of
one
star
falls
somewhere
near
the
innermost
dark
ring
in
the
Airy
disk
of
the
other
star
the
resolving
power
of
a
lens
can
therefore
be
regarded
as
about
half
the
f
number
of
the
lens
expressed
in
microns
The
angular
resolution
of
a
telescope
is
equal
to
the
angle
subtended
by
the
least
resolvable
image
separation
at
the
focal
length
of
the
objective
the
light
gathering
lens
This
works
out
at
about
four
and
a
half
seconds
of
arc
divided
by
the
diameter
of
the
objective
in
inches
The
Rayleigh
limit
As
noted
above
when
a
perfect
lens
forms
an
image
of
a
point
source
of
light
the
emerging
wave
is
a
sphere
centred
about
the
image
point
The
optical
paths
from
all
points
on
the
wave
to
the
image
are
therefore
equal
so
that
the
expanding
wavelets
are
all
in
phase
vibrating
in
unison
when
they
reach
the
image
In
an
imperfect
lens
however
because
of
the
presence
of
aberrations
the
emerging
wave
is
not
a
perfect
sphere
and
the
optical
paths
from
the
wave
to
the
image
point
are
then
not
all
equal
In
such
a
case
some
wavelets
will
reach
the
image
as
a
peak
some
as
a
trough
and
there
will
be
much
destructive
interference
leading
to
the
formation
of
a
sizable
patch
of
light
much
different
from
the
minute
Airy
disk
characteristic
of
a
perfectly
corrected
lens
In
Rayleigh
studied
the
effects
of
phase
inequalities
in
a
star
image
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
an
image
will
not
be
seriously
degraded
unless
the
path
differences
between
one
part
of
the
wave
and
another
exceed
one
quarter
of
the
wavelength
of
light
As
this
difference
represents
only
micron
inch
it
is
evident
that
an
optical
system
must
be
designed
and
constructed
with
almost
superhuman
care
if
it
is
to
give
the
best
possible
definition

The
use
of
polished
mirrors
for
reflecting
light
has
been
known
for
thousands
of
years
and
concave
mirrors
have
long
been
used
to
form
real
images
of
distant
objects
Indeed
Isaac
Newton
greatly
preferred
the
use
of
a
mirror
as
a
telescope
objective
to
the
poor
quality
lenses
available
in
his
time
Because
there
is
no
limit
to
the
possible
size
of
a
mirror
all
large
telescopes
today
are
of
this
type
When
a
ray
of
light
is
reflected
at
a
polished
surface
the
angle
of
reflection
between
ray
and
normal
the
line
at
right
angles
to
the
surface
is
exactly
equal
to
the
angle
of
incidence
It
can
be
seen
that
a
convex
mirror
forms
a
virtual
image
of
a
distant
object
whereas
a
concave
mirror
forms
a
real
image
A
plane
mirror
forms
a
virtual
image
of
near
objects
as
in
the
familiar
looking
glass
Plane
mirrors
are
often
used
in
instruments
to
bend
a
beam
of
light
into
a
different
direction
The
law
of
refraction
When
a
ray
of
light
meets
the
surface
of
separation
between
two
transparent
media
it
is
sharply
bent
or
refracted
Because
rays
are
really
only
directions
and
have
no
physical
existence
the
passage
of
light
waves
through
a
surface
must
be
considered
if
refraction
is
to
be
understood
Refraction
effects
are
based
on
the
fact
that
light
travels
more
slowly
in
a
denser
medium
The
ratio
of
the
velocity
of
light
in
air
to
its
velocity
in
the
medium
is
called
the
refractive
index
of
the
medium
for
light
of
a
particular
colour
or
wavelength
The
refractive
index
is
higher
for
blue
light

for

At
first
lenses
were
made
from
selected
pieces
of
window
glass
or
the
glass
used
to
make
blown
tableware
In
the
early
s
the
manufacture
of
clear
glass
that
was
intended
specifically
for
lenses
began
in
Europe
The
glass
was
slowly
stirred
in
the
molten
state
to
remove
striations
and
irregularities
and
then
the
whole
mass
was
cooled
and
broken
up
into
suitable
pieces
for
lens
making
Subsequently
the
pieces
were
placed
in
molds
of
the
approximate
size
of
the
lens
slowly
remelted
to
shape
and
carefully
annealed
i
e
allowed
to
cool
slowly
under
controlled
conditions
to
reduce
strains
and
imperfections
Various
chemicals
were
added
in
the
molten
state
to
vary
the
properties
of
the
glass
addition
of
lead
oxide
for
example
was
found
to
raise
both
the
refractive
index
and
the
dispersive
power
In
it
was
discovered
that
barium
oxide
had
the
effect
of
raising
the
refractive
index
without
increasing
the
dispersion
a
property
that
proved
to
be
of
the
greatest
value
in
the
design
of
photographic
lenses
known
as
anastigmats
lenses
devoid
of
astigmatic
aberration
In
a
further
major
improvement
was
achieved
by
the
use
of
various
rare
earth
elements
and
since
lanthanum
glass
has
been
commonly
used
in
high
quality
photographic
lenses
The
cost
of
optical
glass
varies
considerably
depending
on
the
type
of
glass
the
precision
with
which
the
optical
properties
are
maintained
the
freedom
from
internal
striae
and
strain
the
number
of
bubbles
and
the
colour
of
the
glass
Many
common
types
of
optical
glass
are
now
available
in
quite
large
pieces
but
as
the
specifications
of
the
glass
become
more
stringent
the
cost
rises
and
the
range
of
available
sizes
becomes
limited
In
a
small
lens
such
as
a
microscope
objective
or
a
telescope
eyepiece
the
cost
of
the
glass
is
insignificant
but
in
large
lenses
in
which
every
millimetre
of
thickness
may
represent
an
additional
pound
in
weight
the
cost
of
the
glass
can
be
very
high
indeed
Lenses
can
be
molded
successfully

various
types
of

polymethyl

Total
internal
reflection
When
a
ray
of
light
emerges
obliquely
from
glass
into
air
the
angle
of
refraction
between
ray
and
normal
is
greater
than
the
angle
of
incidence
inside
the
glass
and
at
a
sufficiently
high
obliquity
the
angle
of
refraction
can
actually
reach
In
this
case
the
emerging
ray
travels
along
the
glass
surface
and
the
sine
of
the
angle
of
incidence
inside
the
glass
known
as
the
critical
angle
is
then
equal
to
the
reciprocal
of
the
refractive
index
of
the
material
At
angles
of
incidence
greater
than
the
critical
angle
the
ray
never
emerges
and

occurs
for
there
is
no

a

Paraxial
or
first
order
imagery
In
a
lens
that
has
spherical
aberration
the
various
rays
from
an
axial
object
point
will
in
general
intersect
the
lens
axis
at
different
points
after
emerging
into
the
image
space
By
tracing
several
rays
entering
the
lens
at
different
heights
i
e
distances
from
the
axis
and
extrapolating
from
a
graph
connecting
ray
height
with
image
position
it
would
be
possible
to
infer
where
a
ray
running
very
close
to
the
axis
a
paraxial
ray
would
intersect
the
axis
although
such
a
ray
could
not
be
traced
directly
by
the
ordinary
trigonometrical
formulas
because
the
angles
would
be
too
small
for
the
sine
table
to
be
of
any
use
Because
the
sine
of
a
small
angle
is
equal
to
the
radian
measure
of
the
angle
itself
however
a
paraxial
ray
can
be
traced
by
reducing
the
ray
tracing
formulas
to
their
limiting
case
for
small
angles
and
thus
determining
the
paraxial
intersection
point
directly
When
this
is
done
writing
paraxial
ray
data
with
lowercase
letters
it
is
found
that
the
Q
and
Q
above
both
become
equal
to
the
height
of
incidence
y
and
the
formulas
a
b
and
c
become
in
the
paraxial
limit
Equations
The
longitudinal
distance
from
the
last
surface
to
the
intersection
point
of
the
emerging
paraxial
ray
with
the
lens
axis
becomes
l
y
u
Because
all
paraxial
rays
from
a
given
object
point
unite
at
the
same
image
point
the
resulting
longitudinal
distance
l
is
independent
of
the
particular
paraxial
ray
that
is
traced
Any
nominal
value
for
the
height
of
incidence
y
may
therefore
be
adopted
remembering
that
it
is
really
an
infinitesimal
and
y
is
only
its
relative
magnitude
Thus
it
is
clear
that
the
paraxial
angles
in
equation
are
really
only
auxiliaries
and
they
can
be
readily
eliminated

the

Magnification

To
obtain
an
expression
for
the
magnification
that
is
the
ratio
of
the
size
of
an
image
to
the
size
of

the
following
process
may
be
used
If
an
object
point
B
lies
to
one
side
of
the
lens
axis
at
a
transverse
distance
h
from
it
and
the

B
is
at
a
transverse
distance
h
then
B
B
and
the
centre
of

of

C

The

In

published
a

on

in
which
he
demonstrated
that
so
far
as
paraxial
rays
are
concerned
a
lens
of
any
degree
of
complexity
can
be
replaced
by
two
principal
or
nodal
points
and
two
focal
points
the
distances
from
the
principal
points
to
their
respective
focal
points
being
the
focal
lengths
of
the
lens
and
furthermore
that
the
two
focal
lengths
are
equal
to
one
another
when
the

indices
of

and

spaces
are
equal

The

may
be

as

Figure

system
of
any
construction
with
a
bundle
of
rays
entering
from
the
left
in
a
direction
parallel
to
the
lens
axis
After
refraction
by
the

each
ray
will
cross
the
axis
at
some
point
and
the
entering
and
emerging
portions
of
each
ray
are
then
extended
until
they
intersect
at
a
point
such
as
Q
The
locus
of
all
the
points
Q
is
a
surface
of
revolution
about
the
lens

known
as
the
equivalent
refracting
locus
of

The
point
where

P

For

are
equal
in

in

if

one
that

F

The
relation
between
the
distances
of

from
a
lens
can
be
easily
stated
if
the
positions
of
the
two

In
using

are
considered
positive

negative
depending
on

The

for
a

because
in
that
case
the
object

and
the
slope

is
zero
If
the

for

The
thin
lens
In
a
thin
lens
such
as
a
spectacle
the
two
principal
planes
coincide
within
the
lens
and
then
the
conjugate
distances
p
and
p
in
the
formula
above
become
the
distances
of
object
and

from
the
lens
itself
The
focal
length
of
a
thin
lens
can
be
computed
by
applying
the
surface
conjugate
formula
to
the
two
surfaces
in
succession
writing
the
l
of
the
first
surface
as

and
the

Chromatic
aberration
Because
the
refractive
index
of
glass
varies
with
wavelength
every
property
of
a
lens
that
depends
on
its
refractive
index
also
varies
with
wavelength
including
the
focal
length
the
image
distance
and
the
image
magnification
The
change
of
image
distance
with
wavelength
is
known
as
chromatic
aberration
and
the
variation
of
magnification
with
wavelength
is
known
as
chromatic
difference
of
magnification
or
lateral
colour
Chromatic
aberration
can
be
eliminated
by
combining
a
strong
lens
of
low
dispersion
glass
crown
with
a
weaker
lens
made
of
high
dispersion
flint
glass
Such
a
combination
is
said
to
be
achromatic
This
method
of
removing
chromatic
aberration
was
discovered
in
by
Chester
Hall
an
English
inventor
and
it
was
exploited
vigorously
in
the
late
th
century
in
numerous
small
telescopes
Chromatic
variation
of
magnification
can
be
eliminated
by
achromatizing
all
the
components
of
a
system
or
by
making
the
system
symmetrical
about
a
central
diaphragm
Both
chromatic
aberration
and
lateral
colour
are
corrected
in
every
high
grade
optical
system
Longitudinal
magnification
If
an
object
is
moved
through
a
short
distance
p
along
the
axis
then
the
corresponding
image
shift
p
is
related
to
the
object
movement
by
the
longitudinal
magnification
m
Succinctly
Equation
in
which
m
is
the
lateral
magnification
The
fact
that
the
longitudinal
magnification
is
equal
to
the
square
of
the
transverse
magnification
means
that
m
is
always
positive
hence
if
the
object
is
moved
from
left
to
right
the
image
must
also
move
from
left
to
right
Also
if
m
is
large
then
m
is
very
large
which
explains
why
the
depth
of
field
p
of
a
microscope
is
extremely
small
On
the
other
hand
if
m
is
small
less
than
one
as
in
a
camera
then
m
is
very
small
and
all
objects
within
a
considerable
range
of
distances
p
appear
substantially
in
focus
Image
of
a
tilted
plane
If
a
lens
is
used
to
form
an
image
of
a
plane
object
that
is
tilted
relative
to
the
lens
axis
then
the
image
will
also
be
tilted
in
such
a
way
that
the
plane
of
the
object
the
plane
of
the
image
and
the
median
plane
of
the
lens
all
meet
This
construction
can
be
derived
by
the
use
of
the
lateral
and
longitudinal
magnification
relations
just
established
above
With
a
tilted
object
the
magnification
at
any
point
is
given
by
the
ratio
of
the
distances
of
image
and
object
from
the
lens
at
that
point
in
the
image
and
consequently
m
varies
progressively
from
one
end
of
the
image
to
the
other
This
arrangement
is
frequently
used
in
view
cameras
equipped
with
swings
to
increase
depth
of
field
and
in
enlargers
to
rectify
the
convergence
of
parallel
lines
caused
by
tilting
the
camera
for
example
in
photographing
tall
buildings
The
rule
finds
extensive
application
in
photogrammetry
and
in
the
making
of
maps
from
aerial
photographs
Optical
systems
System
components
An
optical
system
consists
of
a
succession
of
elements
which
may
include
lenses
mirrors
light
sources
detectors
projection
screens
reflecting
prisms
dispersing
devices
filters
and
thin
films
and
fibre
optics
bundles
Lenses
All
optical
systems
have
an
aperture
stop
somewhere
in
the
system
to
limit
the
diameter
of
the
beams
of
light
passing
through
the
system
from
an
object
point
By
analogy
with
the
human
eye
this
limiting
aperture
stop
is
called
the
iris
of
the
system
its
images
in
the
object
and
image
spaces
being
called
the
entrance
pupil
and
exit
pupil
respectively
In
most
photographic
lenses
the
iris
is
inside
the
objective
and
it
is
often
adjustable
in
diameter
to
control
the
image
illumination
and
the
depth
of
field
In
telescope
and
microscope
systems
the
cylindrical
mount
of
the
objective
lens
is
generally
the
limiting
aperture
or
iris
of
the
system
its
image
formed
behind
the
eyepiece
where
the
observer
s
eye
must
be
located
to
see
the
whole
area
being
observed
called
the
field
is
then
the
exit
pupil
The
pupils
of
a
lens
system
can
be
regarded
as
the
common
bases
of
oblique
beams
passing
through
the
system
from
all
points
in
an
extended
object
In
most
systems
however
the
mounts
of
some
of
the
lens
elements
cut
into
the
oblique
beams
and
prevent
the
beams
from
being
perfectly
circular
and
the
pupils
are
then
not
fully
filled
with
light
This
effect
is
known
as
vignetting
and
leads
to
a
reduction
in
illumination
in
the
outer
parts
of
the

A
common
feature
of
many
optical
systems
is
a
relay
lens
which
may
be
introduced
to
invert
an
image
or
to
extend
the
length
of
the
system
as
in
a
military
periscope
An
example
of
the
use
of
a
relay
lens
is
found
in
the
common
rifle
sight
shown
diagrammatically
in
Figure
Here
the
front
lens
A
is
the
objective
forming
an
inverted
image
of
the
target
on
the
cross
wire
or
reticle
at
B
The
light
then
proceeds
to
the
relay
lens
C
which
forms
a
second
image
now
erect
at
D
Beyond
this
image
is
the
eyepiece
E
to
render
the
light
parallel
so
that
the
image
may
be
seen
sharply
by
the
observer
Unfortunately
the
oblique
beam
from
the
objective
will
usually
miss
the
relay
lens
and
so
a
field
lens
must
be
inserted
at
or
near
the
first
image
B
to
bend
the
oblique
beams
around
and
redirect
them
toward
the
relay
lens
The
power
of
the
field
lens
is
chosen
so
that
it
will
form
an
image
of
the
objective
lens
aperture
on
the
relay
lens
aperture
The
iris
and
entrance
pupil
of
this
system
coincide
at
the
objective
there
is
an
internal
pupil
at
the
relay
lens
and
the
exit
pupil
lies
beyond

Mirrors
Mirrors
are
frequently
used
in
optical
systems
Plane
mirrors
may
be
employed
to

for
convenience

Curved
mirrors
concave
and
convex
may
be
used
in
place
of

as
image
forming
elements
in
reflecting
telescopes
All
of
the
world
s
largest
telescopes
and
many
small
ones
are
of
the
reflecting
type
Such
telescopes
use
a
concave
mirror
to
produce
the
main
image
a
small
secondary
mirror
often
being
added
to
magnify
the
image
and
to
place
it
in
a
convenient
position
for
observation
or
photography
Telescope
mirrors
are
commonly
made
parabolic
or
hyperbolic
in
section
to
correct
the
aberrations
of
the
image
Originally
telescope
mirrors
were
made
from
polished
speculum
metal
an
alloy
of
copper
and
tin
but
in
Justus
von
Liebig
a
German
chemist
invented
a
process
for
forming
a
mirror
like
layer
of
silver
on
polished
glass
which
was
applied
to
telescope
mirrors
by
the
German
astronomer
C
A
von
Steinheil
Today
most
mirrors
are
made
of
glass
coated
with
either
a
chemically
deposited
silver
layer
or
more
often
one
made
by
depositing
vaporized
aluminum
on
the
surface
The
aluminum
surface
is
as
highly
reflective
as
silver
and
does
not
tarnish
as
readily
A
large
astronomical
mirror
presents
many
problems
to
the
optical
engineer
mainly
because
even
a
distortion
of
a
few
microns
of
the
mirror
under
its
own
weight
will
cause
an
intolerable
blurring
of
the
image
Though
many
schemes
for
supporting
a
mirror
without
strain
have
been
tried
including
one
to
support
it
on
a
bag
of
compressed
air
the
problem
of
completely
eliminating
mirror
distortion
remains
unsolved
A
metal
mirror
if
well
ribbed
on
the
back
may
be
lighter
than
a
glass
mirror
and
therefore
easier
to
handle
but
most
metals
are
slightly
flexible
and
require
just
as
careful
support
as
glass
mirrors
Since
temperature
changes
can
also
cause
serious
distortion
in
a
mirror
astronomers
try
to
hold
observatory
temperatures
as
constant
as
possible
Light

Many
types
of
optical
instruments
form
images
by
natural
light
but
some
such
as
microscopes
and
projectors

a
source
of
artificial
light
Tungsten
filament
lamps
are
the
most
common
but
if
a
very
bright
source
is
required
a
carbon
or
xenon
arc
is
employed
For
some
applications
mercury
or
other
gas
discharge
tubes
are
used
a
laser
beam
is
often
employed
in
scientific
applications
Laser
light
is
brilliant
monochromatic
collimated
the
rays
are
parallel
and
coherent
the
waves
are
all
in
step
with
each
other
any
or
all
of
these
properties
being
of
value
in
particular
cases
Detectors
The
image
formed
by
an
optical
system
is
usually
received
by
the
eye
which
is
a
remarkably
adaptable
and
sensitive
detector
of
radiation
within
the
visible
region
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
A
photographic
film
another
widely
used
detector
has
the
advantage
of
yielding
a
permanent
record
of
events
Since
about
many
types
of
electrical
detectors
of
radiation
both
within
the
visible
region
and
beyond
it
have
been
developed
These
include
photoelectric
cells
of
various
kinds
in
which
either
a
voltage
or
a
resistance
is
modified
by
light
falling
on
the
device
Many
new
types
of
detectors
are
sensitive
far
into
the
infrared
spectrum
and
are
used
to
detect
the
heat
radiated
by
a
flame
or
other
hot
object
A
number
of
image
intensifiers
and
converters
particularly
for
X
ray
or
infrared
radiation
which
have
appeared
since
World
War
II
embody
a
radiation
detector
at
one
end
of
a
vacuum
tube
and
an
electron
lens
inside
the
tube
to
relay
the
image
on
to
a
phosphor
screen
at
the
other
end
This
arrangement
produces
a
visible
picture
that
may
be
observed
by
eye
or
photographed
to
make
a
permanent
record
Television
camera
tubes
detect
real
images
by
electronic
scanning
the
picture
on
the
viewing
tube
being
a
replica
of
the
image
in
the
original
camera
The
combined
application
of
electronics
and
optics
has
become
common
An
extreme
example
of
electro
optics
appears
in
some
space
cameras
in
which
the
film
is
exposed
processed
and
then
scanned
by
a
tiny
point
of
light
the
light
passing
through
the
film
is
picked
up
by
a
photocell
and
transmitted
to
Earth
by
radio
where
it
is
made
to
control
the
brightness
of
another
point
of
light
scanning
a
second
piece
of
film
in
exact
synchronism
with
the
scanning
spot
in
the
camera
The
whole
system
thus
produces
a
picture
on
Earth
that
is
an
exact
replica
of
the
picture
photographed
in
space
a
few
minutes
earlier
Projection
screens
The
simplest
screen
for
the
projection
of
slides
or
motion
pictures
is
of
course
a
matte
white
surface
which
may
be
on
a
hard
base
as
in
outdoor
theatres
or
on
a
stretched
cloth
indoors
A
theatre
screen
is
often
perforated
to
transmit
sound
from
loudspeakers
placed
behind
it
Improved
screen
materials
have
been
developed
to
increase
the
brightness
of
the
picture
to
suit
the
particular
shape
of
the
auditorium
A
screen
covered
with
tiny
beads
tends
to
send
the
light
back
in
the
general
direction
of
the
projector
and
is
suitable
for
use
at
one
end
of
a
long
narrow
auditorium
Another
type
of
screen
is
covered
with
fine
embossed
vertical
grooves
this
tends
to
distribute
the
light
in
a
horizontal
band
across
the
audience
with
little
or
no
vertical
spread
A
real
advantage
of
these
highly
reflective
screens
is
that
they
tend
to
reflect
ambient
room
light
away
from
the
viewer
as
by
a
mirror
so
that
the
pictures
appear
almost
as
bright
and
clear
by
day
as
in
a
darkened
room
Reflecting
prisms
Reflecting
prisms
are
pieces
of
glass
bounded
by
plane
surfaces
set
at
carefully
specified
angles
Some
of
these
surfaces
transmit
light
some
reflect
light
while
some
serve
both
functions
in
succession
A
prism
is
thus
an
assembly
of
plane
reflectors
at
relatively
fixed
angles
which
are
traversed
in
succession
by
a
beam
of
light

The
simplest
prism
is
a
triangular
block
of
glass
with
two
faces
at
right
angles
and
one
at
an
angle
of
The
face

deflects
a
beam
of
light
through
a

The
common
Porro
prism
used
in
a
pair
of
binoculars
contains
four
reflecting
surfaces
two
to
reverse
the
beam
direction
in
the
vertical
plane
and
two
in
the
horizontal
plane
Figure
These
reflecting
faces
could
be
replaced
by
pieces
of
mirror
mounted
on
a
metal
frame
but
it
is
hard
to
hold
mirrors
rigidly
and
harder
still
to
keep
them
clean
Some
microscopes
are
equipped
with
a
deflection
prism
behind
the
eyepiece
this
prism
may
provide
two
or
three
reflections

on
the
type
of

Prisms
containing
a
semireflecting
semitransmitting
surface
are
known
as
beam
splitters
and
as
such
have
many
uses
An
important
application
is
found
in
some
colour
television
cameras
in
which
the
light
from
the
lens
is
divided
by
two
beam
splitters
in
succession
to
form
red
green
and
blue
images
on
the
faces
of
three

tubes

the

Dispersing
devices
There
are
two
forms
of
dispersing
element
used
to
spread
out
the
constituent
colours
of
a
beam
of
light
into
a
spectrum
namely
a
prism
and
a
grating
The
prism
known
to
Newton
is
the
older
it
separates
the
colours
of
the
spectrum
because
the
refractive
index
of
the
glass
is
lowest
for
red
light
and
progressively
increases
through
the
yellow
and
green
to
the
blue
where
it
is
highest
Prism
spectroscopes
and
spectrographs
are
made
in
a
variety
of
forms
and
sizes
but
in
all
cases
the
blue
end
of
the
spectrum
is
greatly
spread
out
while
the
red
end
is
relatively
compressed
A
diffraction
grating
is
a
ruled
mirror
or
transparent
plate
of
glass
having
many
thousands
of
fine
parallel
grooves
to
the
inch
It
separates
the
colours
of
the
spectrum
by
a
process
of
diffraction
Each
groove
diffracts
or
scatters
light
in
all
directions
and
in
the
case
of
light
of
one
particular
wavelength
there
will
be
one
direction
in
which
the
light
wave
from
one
groove
lags
behind
the
light
wave
from
the
next
groove
by
precisely
one
or
more
whole
wavelengths
This
results
in
a
strong
beam
of
diffracted
light
in
that
direction
and
darkness
in
all
other
directions
Since
each
spectral
colour
corresponds
to
a
different
wavelength
the
grating
spreads
out
the
spectrum
into
a
fan
where
it
can
be
observed
or
photographed
The
red
rays
are
bent
most
and
the
blue
rays
least
the
opposite
of
the
situation
with
a
prism
Although
a
prism
or
grating
is
the
essential
dispersing
element
in
a
spectrograph
a
fine
slit
and
additional
lenses
or
focussing
mirrors
must
be
used
to
form
a
sharply
defined
spectrum
Prism
spectroscopes
are
of
course
limited
to
those
wavelengths
for
which
the
prism
material
is
transparent
a
reflecting
grating
can
be
used
for
any
wavelength
that
the
material
will
reflect
Filters
and
thin
films
A
colour
filter
is
a
sheet
of
transparent
material
that
modifies
a
light
beam
by
selective
absorption
of
some
colours
in
relation
to
others
A
neutral
filter
absorbs
all
wavelengths
equally
and
merely
serves
to
reduce
the
intensity
of
a
beam
of
light
without
changing
its
colour
Filters
may
be
made
from
sheets
of
coloured
glass
plastic
or
dyed
gelatin
and
in
some
cases
glass
cells
filled
with
liquid
have
been
used
Since
World
War
II
another
type
of
filter
depending
on
the
interference
of
light
has
been
developed
in
which
one
or
more
metallic
or
other
types
of
films
of
controlled
thickness
have
been
deposited
on
a
glass
plate
the
layers
being
so
thin
as
to
cause
selective
interference
of
some
wavelengths
in
relation
to
others
and
thus
act
as
a
nonabsorbing
filter
In
this
case
the
rejected
colours
are
reflected
instead
of
being
absorbed
Polarizing
filters
have
the
property
of
transmitting
light
that
vibrates
in
one
direction
while
absorbing
light
that
vibrates
in
a
perpendicular
direction
These
filters
are
used
extensively
in
scientific
instruments
In
sunglasses
and
when
placed
over
a
camera
lens
polarizing
filters
reduce
unwanted
reflections
from
nonmetallic
surfaces
Polarizing
spectacles
have
been
used
to
separate
the
left
eye
and
right
eye
beams
in
the
projection
of
stereoscopic
pictures
or
movies

As
noted
earlier
a
thin
rod
or
fibre
of
glass
or
other
transparent
material
transmits
light
by
repeated
internal
reflections
even
when
the
rod
is
somewhat
curved
An
ordered
bundle
of
rods
or
fibres
is
thus
capable
of
taking
an
image
projected
upon
one
end
of
the
bundle
and
reproducing
it
at
the
other
end
A
fibre

can
be
fused
together
into
a
rigid
channel
or
it
may
be
left

only
the
ends
being

together
Because
a
fibre
bundle
is
exceedingly
delicate
it
must
be
handled
with
care

dot
to

Nonclassical
imaging
systems
Besides
the
familiar
optical
systems
cited
above
there
are
many
nonclassical
optical
elements
that
are
used
to
a
limited
extent
for
special
purposes
The
most
familiar
of
these
is
the
aspheric
nonspherical
surface
Because
plane
and
spherical
surfaces
are
the
easiest
to
generate
accurately
on
glass
most
lenses
contain
only
such
surfaces
It
is
occasionally
necessary
however
to
use
some
other
axially
symmetric
surface
on
a
lens
or
mirror
generally
to
correct
a
particular
aberration
An
example
is
the
parabolic
surface
used
for
the
primary
mirror
of
a
large
astronomical
telescope
another
is
the
elliptic
surface
molded
on
the
front
of
the
little
solid
glass
reflector
units
used
on
highway
signs
Another
commonly
used
optical
surface
is
the
side
of
a
cylinder
Such
surfaces
have
power
only
in
the
meridian
perpendicular
to
the
cylinder
axis
Cylindrical
lenses
are
therefore
used
wherever
it
is
desired
to
vary
the
magnification
from
one
meridian
to
a
perpendicular
meridian
Cylindrical
surfaces
are
employed
in
the
anamorphic
lenses
used
in
some
wide
screen
motion
picture
systems
to
compress
the
image
horizontally
in
the
camera
and
stretch
it
back
to
its
original
shape
in
the
projected
image
To
correct
astigmatism
in
the
eye
many
spectacles
are
made
with
toric
surfaces
i
e
with
a
stronger
curvature
in
one
meridian
than
in
the
perpendicular
meridian
like
the
bowl
of
a
teaspoon
These
surfaces
are
generated
and
polished
by
special
machines
and
are
made
by
the
million
every
year
Another
nonclassical
optical
system
is
the
bifocal
or
trifocal
spectacle
lens
They
are
made
either
by
forming
two
or
three
separate
surfaces
on
a
single
piece
of
glass
or
obtaining
additional
power
by
fusing
a
piece
of
high
index
glass
on
to
the
front
of
the
main
lens
and
then
polishing
a
single
spherical
surface
over
both
glasses
Two
French
scientists
Georges
Louis
Buffon
and
Augustin
Jean
Fresnel
in
the
th
century
suggested
forming
a
lens
in
concentric
rings
to
save
weight
each
ring
being
a
portion
of
what
would
normally
be
a
continuous
spherical
surface
but
flattened
out
On
a
large
scale
Fresnel
lenses
have
been
used
in
lighthouses
floodlights
and
traffic
signals
and
as
cylindrical
ship
s
lanterns
With
fine
steps
a
few
thousandths
of
an
inch
wide
molded
plastic
Fresnel
lenses
are
often
used
as
condensers
in
overhead
projectors
and
in
cameras
as
a
field
lens
in
contact
with
a
ground
glass
viewing
screen
Lenses
have
occasionally
been
made
with
one
surface
taking
the
form
of
a
flattened
cone
Such
lenses
produce
a
long
linear
image
of
a
point
source
lying
along
the
lens
axis
for
this
reason
they
are
commonly
referred
to
as
axicons
They
have
been
used
to
produce
a
straight
line
of
light
in
space
for
aligning
machines
and
shafting
but
since
about
the
beam
from
a
gas
laser
has
generally
been
used
instead
Lens
aberrations
Seidel
sums
If
a
lens
were
perfect
and
the
object
were
a
single
point
of
monochromatic
light
then
as
noted
above
the
light
wave
emerging
from
the
lens
would
be
a
portion
of
a
sphere
centred
about
the
ideal
image
point
lying
in
the
paraxial
image
plane
at
a
height
above
the
axis
given
by
the
Lagrange
theorem
In
practice
however
this
condition
is
most
unlikely
to
occur
it
is
much
more
probable
that
the
emerging
wave
will
depart
slightly
from
a
perfect
sphere
the
departure
varying
from
point
to
point
over
the
lens
aperture
This
departure
is
extremely
small
being
of
the
order
of
the
wavelength
of
light
that
is
only
half
a
micron
so
it
would
be
impossible
to
show
this
departure
on
a
drawing
It
can
be
represented
mathematically
however
in
the
following
way
The
coordinates
of
a
point
in
the
exit
pupil
aperture
will
be
represented
by
x
and
y
the
y
coordinate
lying
in
the
meridian
plane
containing
the
object
point
and
the
lens
axis
The
departure
of
the
wave
from
the
ideal
sphere
is
generally
called
OPD
meaning
optical
path
difference
It
can
be
shown
that
OPD
is
related
to
x
and
y
by
five
constants
S
through
S
and
the
quantity
h
o
Equation
Each
of
these
five
terms
is
considered
to
be
a
separate
aberration
the
coefficients
S
S
being
called
Seidel
sums
after
the
th
century
German
scientist
L
P
Seidel
who
identified
the
imperfections
These
aberrations
are
respectively
spherical
coma
astigmatism
Petzval
field
curvature
and
distortion
The
symbol
h
refers
to
the
height
of
the
final
image
point
above
the
lens
axis
and
hence
it
defines
the
obliquity
of
the
beam
The
five
Seidel
sums
can
be
calculated
by
tracing
a
paraxial
ray
from
object
to
image
through
the
lens
and
by
tracing
also
a
paraxial
principal
ray
from
the
centre
of
the
aperture
stop
outward
in
both
directions
toward
the
object
and
image
respectively
The
angle
of
incidence
i
and
the
ray
slope
angle
u
of
each
of
these
paraxial
rays
at
each
surface
are
then
listed
and
inserted
into
the
following
expressions
for
the
five
sums
The
angle
u
represents
the
final
emerging
slope
of
the
paraxial
ray
The
calculation
starts
by
determining
the
radius
A
of
the
exit
pupil
by
A
Square
root
of
x
y
and
also
the
quantity
K
at
each
surface
by
Equation
The
corresponding
K
pr
for
the
paraxial
principal
ray
is
also
determined
at
each
surface
Then
the
five
aberrations
may
be
written
Equations
Equations
Equation
To
interpret
these
aberrations
the
simplest
procedure
is
to
find
the
components
x
y
of
the
displacement
of
a
ray
from
the
Lagrangian
image
point
in
the
paraxial
focal
plane
by
differentiating
the
OPD
expression
given
above
The
partial
derivatives
OPD
x
and
OPD
y
represent
respectively
the
components
of
the
slope
of
the
wave
relative
to
the
reference
sphere
at
any
particular
point
x
y
Hence
because
a
ray
is
always
perpendicular
to
the
wave
the
ray
displacements
in
the
focal
plane
can
be
found
by
Equations
in
which
f
is
the
focal
length
of
the
lens
The
aggregation
of
rays
striking
the
focal
plane
will
indicate
the
kind
of
image
that
is
characteristic
of
each
aberration
This
procedure
will
be
applied
to
each
of
the
five
aberration
terms
separately
assuming
that
all
the
other
aberrations
are
absent
Obviously
in
a
perfect
lens
x
and
y
are
zero
because
OPD
is
zero
It
must
be
remembered
however
that
by
using
rays
instead
of
waves
all
fine
structure
effects
caused
by
diffraction
will
be
lost
and
only
the
macroscopic
image
structure
will
be
retained

These

can

which

a

of
a

the

of

The

components
are
as

Equations
When
this
aberration
is
present
each
circular
zone
of
the
lens
forms
a
small
ringlike
image
in
the
focal
plane
the
rings
formed
by
successive
concentric
zones
of
the
lens
fitting
into
two
straight
envelope
lines
at

each

Because
the
brightness
of
this

is
greatest
at
the
tip

to
form
a
one

on
images
in
the
outer
parts
of
the
field
Astigmatism
If
only
the
S
term
is
present
then
Equations
For
any
one
zone
of
the
lens
x
and
y
describe
a
vertical
ellipse
with
major
axis
three
times
the
minor
axis
The
images
formed
by
all
the
smaller
zones
of
the
lens
fit
into
this
ellipse
and
fill
it
out
with
a
uniform
intensity
of
light
If
the
image
plane
is
moved
along
the
axis
by
a
distance
L
as
in
focussing
a
camera
then
at
L
f
h
S
the
ellipse
shrinks
to
a
radial
focal
line
R
Twice
this
displacement
yields
a
circle
three

L
gives
a
tangential
focal
line
T
which
is
followed
by
an
ellipse
with
its
major
axis
in
the
x
direction
as
in
Figure

The
usual
effect
of
astigmatism
in
an
image
is
the
appearance
of
radial
or
tangential
blurring
in
the
outer
parts
of
the
field
Petzval
curvature
For
the
S
term
taken
alone
Equations
The
image
of
a
point
is
now
a
small
circle
that
contracts
to
a
point
at
a
new
focus
situated
at
a
longitudinal
distance
L
f
h
S
from
the
paraxial
image
As
the
longitudinal
displacement
of
the
focus
is
proportional
to
the
square
of
the
image
height
h
this
aberration
represents
a
pure
field
curvature
without
any
accompanying
loss
of
definition
all
lines
remain
sharp
It
is
named
after
the
Hungarian
mathematician
J
zsef
Petzval
who
studied
its
properties
in
the
early
s
The
effect
of
Petzval
curvature
can
be
somewhat
offset
by
the
deliberate
introduction
of
sufficient
overcorrected
astigmatism
as
was
done
in
all
the
pre
anastigmat
photographic
objectives
This
added
astigmatism
is
of
course
undesirable
and
in
order
to
design
an
anastigmat
lens
having
a
flat
field
free
from
astigmatism
it
is
necessary
to
reduce
the
Petzval
sum
S
drastically
For
a
succession
of
thin
lenses
etc
in
a
system
the
Petzval
sum
becomes
simply
f
n
f
n
f
n
etc
in
which
f
is
the
focal
length
of
each
element
and
n
is
its
refractive
index
Therefore
to
reduce
the
sum
and
minimize
this
aberration
relatively
strong
negative
elements
of
low
index
glass
can
be
combined
with
positive
elements
of
high
index
glass
The
positive
and
negative
elements
must
be
axially
separated
to
provide
the
lens
with
a
useful
amount
of
positive
power
The
introduction
of
high
index
barium
crown
glass
with
a
low
dispersive
power
in
the
s
initiated
the
development
of
anastigmat
lenses
Distortion
For
the
S
aberration
Equations
When
this
aberration
is
present
the
entire
image
point
is
displaced
toward
or
away
from
the
axis
by
an
amount
proportional
to
the
third
power
of
the
transverse
distance
h
of
the
image
from
the
axis
This
leads
to
the
formation
of
an
image
of
a
square
that
is
either
a
barrel
shaped
or
a
cushion
shaped
figure
It
is
to
be
noted
that
the
five
Seidel
aberrations
represent
the
largest
and
most
conspicuous
defects
that
can
arise
in
an
uncorrected
optical
system
Even
in
the
best
lenses
in
which
these
five
aberrations
have
been
perfectly
corrected
for
one
zone
of
the
lens
and
for
one
point
in
the
field
however
there
will
exist
small
residuals
of
these
aberrations
and
of
many
other
higher
order
aberrations
also
which
are
significantly
different
from
the
classical
types
just
described
The
typical
aberration
figures
shown
in
Figure
are
of
course
grossly
exaggerated
and
actually
it
requires
some
magnification
of
a
star
image
to
render
these
appearances
clearly
visible
Nevertheless
they
are
important
enough
to
require
drastic
reduction
in
high
quality
lenses
intended
to
make
sharp
negatives
capable
of
considerable
enlargement
Image
brightness
General
relations
All
photometric
concepts
are
based
on
the
idea
of
a
standard
candle
lamps
having
accurately
known
candle
power
being
obtainable
from
the
various
national
standards
laboratories
The
ratio
of
the
candle
power
of
a
source
to
its
area
is
called
the
luminance
of
the
source
luminances
range
from
about
candles
per
square
millimetre
at
the
surface
of
the
Sun
down
to
about
candle
per
square
centimetre
stilb
for
the
luminous
paint
on
a
watch
dial
Ordinary
outdoor
scenes
in
daylight
have
an
average
luminance
of
several
hundred
candles
per
square
foot
The
quantity
of
light
flux
flowing
out
from
a
source
is
measured
in
lumens
the
lumen
being
defined
as
the
amount
of
flux
radiated
by
a
small
point
source
of
one
candle
power
into
a
cone
having
a
solid
angle
of
one
steradian
When
light
falls
upon
a
surface
it
produces
illumination
i
e
illuminance
the
usual
measure
of
illuminance
being
the
foot
candle
which
is
one
lumen
falling
on
each
square
foot
of
receiving
surface
It
is
often
important
to
be
able
to
calculate
the
brightness
of
an
image
formed
by
an
optical
system
because
photographic
emulsions
and
other
light
receptors
cannot
respond
satisfactorily
if
the
light
level
is
too
low
The
problem
is
to
relate
the
luminance
of
an
object
with
the
illuminance
in
the
image
knowing
the
transmittance
and
aperture
of
the
optical
system
A
small
area
A
of
a
plane
object
having
a
luminance
of
B
candles
per
square
unit
will
have
a
normal
intensity
of
AB
candles
This
source
radiates
light
into
a
cone
of
semi
angle
U
limited
for
example
by
the
rim
of
a
lens
The
light
flux
F
entering
the
cone
can
be
found
by
integration
to
be
Equation
If
the
object
luminance
is
expressed
as
B
L
lamberts
the
lambert
being
an
alternative
luminance
unit
equal
to
i
e
candle
per
unit
area
the
flux
F
is
Equation
because
there
are
times
as
many
lamberts
in
a
given
luminance
as
there
are
candles
per
unit
area
A
fraction
t
of
this
flux
finds
its
way
to
the
image
t
being
the
lens
transmittance
generally
about
or
but
less
if
a
mirror
is
involved
The
area
of
the
image
is
Am
in
which
m
the
magnification
is
given
by
Equation
Hence
the
image
illuminance
E
is
Equations
The
image
illuminance
thus
depends
only
on
the
luminance
of
the
source
and
the
cone
angle
of
the
beam
proceeding
from
the
lens
to
the
image
This
is
a
basic
and
most
important
relation
underlying
all
calculations
of
image
illuminance
It
is
often
more
convenient
to
convert
the
angle
U
into
other
better
known
quantities
such
as
the
f
number
of
the
lens
and
the
image
magnification
The
relation
here
is
Equation
The
f
number
of
the
lens
is
defined
as
the
ratio
of
the
focal
length
to
the
diameter
of
the
entrance
pupil
m
is
the
image
magnification
and
m
p
is
the
pupil
magnification
i
e
the
diameter
of
the
exit
pupil
divided
by
the
diameter
of
the
entrance
pupil
Combining
equations
and
gives
Equation
As
an
example
in
the
use
of
this
relation
if
it
is
supposed
that
an
f
lens
is
being
used
to
project
an
image
of
a
cathode
ray
tube
at
five
times
magnification
the
tube
luminance
being
foot
lamberts
candles
per
square
centimetre
the
lens
transmittance
is
and
the
pupil
magnification
is
unity
Then
the
image
illuminance
will
be
Equation
The
image
is
very
much
less
bright
than
the
object
a
fact
that
becomes
clear
to
anyone
attempting
to
provide
a
bright
projected
image
in
a
large
auditorium
Distribution
of
illumination
over
an
image
So
far
only
the
illumination
at
the
centre
of
an
image
has
been
considered
but
the
distribution
of
illumination
over
a
wide
field
is
often
important
In
the
absence
of
any
lens
the
small
plane
source
already
considered
radiates
in
a
direction
inclined
at
an
angle
to
the
axis
with
an
intensity
AB
cos
This
light
has
to
travel
farther
than
the
axial
light
to
reach
a
screen
and
then
it
strikes
the
screen
at
another
angle
The
net
result
is
that
the
oblique
illumination
on
the
screen
is
smaller
than
the
axial
illumination
by
the
factor
cos
The
same
law
can
be
applied
to
determine
the
oblique
illumination
due
to
a
lens
assuming
a
uniform
extended
diffusing
source
of
light
on
the
other
side
of
the
lens
In
this
case
however
the
exit
pupil
will
not
in
general
be
a
perfect
circle
because
of
possible
distortion
of
the
iris
by
that
part
of
the
optical
system
lying
between
the
iris
and
the
image
Also
any
mechanical
vignetting
in
the
lens
will
make
the
aperture
noncircular
and
reduce
still
further
the
oblique
illumination
In
a
camera
this
reduction
in
oblique
illumination
results
in
darkened
corners
of
the
picture
but
if
the
reduction
in
brightness
is
gradual
it
is
not
likely
to
be
detected
because
the
eye
adapts
quickly
to
changing
brightness
as
the
eyes
scan
over
the
picture
area
Indeed
a
percent
drop
in
brightness
between
the
centre
and
corners
of
an
ordinary
picture
is
scarcely
detectable
Visual
brightness
The
apparent
brightness
of
things
seen
by
the
eye
follows
the
same
laws
as
any
other
imaging
system
because
the
apparent
brightness
is
measured
by
the
illuminance
in
the
image
that
is
projected
on
the
retina
The
angle
U
in
equation
inside
the
eye
is
determined
by
the
size
of
the
pupil
of
the
eye
which
varies
from
about
one
millimetre
to
about
eight
millimetres
depending
on
the
brightness
of
the
environment
Apart
from
this
variation
retinal
illuminance
is
directly
proportional
to
object
luminance
and
objects
having
the
same
luminance
appear
equally
bright
no
matter
at
what
distance
they
are
observed
From
this
argument
it
is
clear
that
no
visual
instrument
such
as
a
telescope
can
possibly
make
anything
appear
brighter
than
when
viewed
directly
To
be
sure
a
telescope
having
a
large
objective
lens
accepts
more
light
from
an
object
in
proportion
to
the
area
of
the
lens
aperture
but
it
magnifies
the
image
area
in
the
same
proportion
so
the
increased
light
is
spread
over
an
increased
area
of
the
retina
and
the
illuminance
remains
unchanged
Actually
the
telescopic
view
is
always
dimmer
than
the
direct
view
because
of
light
losses
in
the
telescope
due
to
glass
absorption
and
surface
reflections
and
because
the
exit
pupil
of
the
telescope
may
be
smaller
than
the
pupil
of
the
eye
thus
reducing
the
angle

The
case
of
a
star
being
observed
through
a
telescope
is
quite
different
because
no
degree
of
magnification
can
possibly
make
a
star
appear
as
anything
other
than
a
point
of
light
Hence
star
images
appear
brighter
in
proportion
to
the
area
of
the
telescope
objective
assuming
that
the
exit
pupil
is
larger
than
the
eye
pupil
and
the
visibility
of
a
star
against
the
sky
background
is
thus
improved
in
proportion
to
the
square
of
the
diameter
of
the
telescope
objective
lens

The
speed
of
light
traveling
through
a
vacuum
is
exactly
meters
feet
per
second
That
s
about
miles
per
second
a
universal
constant
known
in
equations
as
c
or
light
speed
According
to
physicist
Albert
Einstein
s
theory
of
special
relativity
on
which
much
of
modern
physics
is
based
nothing
in
the
universe
can
travel
faster
than
light
The
theory
states
that
as
matter
approaches
the
speed
of
light
the
matter
s
mass
becomes
infinite
That
means
the
speed
of
light
functions
as
a
speed
limit
for
the
whole
universe
The
speed
of
light
is
so
immutable
that
according
to
the
U
S
National
Institute
of
Standards
and
Technology
it
is
used
to
define
international
standard
measurements
like
the
meter
and
by
extension
the
mile
the
foot
and
the
inch
Through
some
crafty
equations
it
also
helps
define
the
kilogram
and
the
temperature

Kelvin

What
is
a
light
year
A
light
year
is
the
distance
that
light
can
travel
in
one
year
about
trillion
miles
trillion
kilometers
It
s
one
way
that
astronomers
and
physicists
measure
immense
distances
across
our
universe
Light
travels
from
the
moon
to
our
eyes
in
about
second
which
means
the
moon
is
about
light
second
away
Sunlight
takes
about
minutes
to
reach
our
eyes
so
the
sun
is
about
light
minutes
away
Light
from
Alpha
Centauri
which
is
the
nearest
star
system
to
our
own
requires
roughly
years
to
get
here
so
Alpha
Centauri
is
light
years
away
To
obtain
an
idea
of
the
size
of
a

take
the
circumference
of
the
Earth
miles
lay
it
out
in

multiply
the
length
of
the

by
the

An

If

the

would
take
approximately
years
according

Stars
and
other
objects
beyond
our
solar

lie
anywhere
from
a
few
light
years
to
a
few
billion
light
years
away
And
everything
astronomers
see
in
the
distant
universe
is
literally
history
When
astronomers
study
objects
that
are
far
away
they
are
seeing
light
that
shows
the
objects
as
they
existed
at
the
time
that

Who
discovered
the
speed
of
light
One
of
the
first
measurements
of
the
speed
of
light
was
by
Ole
R
mer
in
by
observing
the
moons
of
Jupiter
The
speed
of
light
was
first
measured
to
high
precision
in
by
the
Michelson
Morley
Experiment
How
do
we
know
the
speed
of
light
Ole
R
mer
was
able
to
measure
the
speed
of
light
by
observing
eclipses
of
Jupiter
s
moon
Io
When
Jupiter
was
closer
to
Earth
R
mer
noted
that
eclipses
of
Io
occurred
slightly
earlier
than
when
Jupiter
was
farther
away
R
mer
attributed
this
effect
to
the
time
it
takes
for
light
to
travel
over
the
longer
distance
when
Jupiter
was
farther
from
the
Earth
How
did
we
learn
the
speed
of
light
Galileo
Galilei
is
credited
with
discovering
the
first
four
moons
of
Jupiter
Aristotle
Empedocles
Galileo
illustrated
here
Ole
R
mer
and
countless
other
philosophers
and
physicists
in
history
have
contemplated
the
speed
of
light
Image

NASA
As
early
as
the
th
century
BC
Greek
philosophers
like
Empedocles
and
Aristotle
disagreed
on
the
nature
of
light
speed
Empedocles
proposed
that
light
whatever
it
was
made
of
must
travel
and
therefore
must
have
a
rate
of
travel
Aristotle
wrote
a
rebuttal
of
Empedocles
view
in
his
own
treatise
On
Sense
and
the
Sensible
arguing
that
light
unlike
sound
and
smell
must
be
instantaneous
Aristotle
was
wrong
of
course
but
it
would
take
hundreds
of
years
for
anyone
to
prove
it
In
the
mid
s
the
Italian
astronomer
Galileo
Galilei
stood
two
people
on
hills
less
than
a
mile
apart
Each
person
held
a
shielded
lantern
One
uncovered
his
lantern
when
the
other
person
saw
the
flash
he
uncovered
his
too
But
Galileo
s
experimental
distance
wasn
t
far
enough
for
his
participants
to
record
the
speed
of
light
He
could
only
conclude
that
light
traveled
at
least
times
faster
than
sound
In
the
s
Danish
astronomer
Ole
R
mer
tried
to
create
a
reliable
timetable
for
sailors
at
sea
and
according
to
NASA
accidentally
came
up
with
a
new
best
estimate
for
the
speed
of
light
To
create
an
astronomical
clock
he
recorded
the
precise
timing
of
the
eclipses
of
Jupiter
s
moon
Io
from
Earth
Over
time
R
mer
observed
that
Io
s
eclipses
often
differed
from
his
calculations
He
noticed
that
the
eclipses
appeared
to
lag
the
most
when
Jupiter
and
Earth
were
moving
away
from
one
another
showed
up
ahead
of
time
when
the
planets
were
approaching
and
occurred
on
schedule
when
the
planets
were
at
their
closest
or
farthest
points
This
observation
demonstrated
what
we
today
know
as
the
Doppler
effect
the
change
in
frequency
of
light
or
sound
emitted
by
a
moving
object
that
in
the
astronomical
world
manifests
as
the
so
called
redshift
the
shift
towards
redder
longer
wavelengths
in
objects
speeding
away
from
us
In
a
leap
of
intuition
R
mer
determined
that
light
was
taking
measurable
time
to
travel
from
Io
to
Earth
R
mer
used
his
observations
to
estimate
the
speed
of
light
Since
the
size
of
the
solar
system
and
Earth
s
orbit
wasn
t
yet
accurately
known
argued
a
paper
in
the
American
Journal
of
Physics
he
was
a
bit
off
But
at
last
scientists
had
a
number
to
work
with
R
mer
s
calculation
put
the
speed
of
light
at
about
miles
per
second
km
s
In
English
physicist
James
Bradley
based
a
new
set
of
calculations
on
the
change
in
the
apparent
position
of
stars
caused
by
Earth
s
travels
around
the
sun
He
estimated
the
speed
of
light
at
miles
per
second
km
s
accurate
to
within
about
of
the
real
value
according
to
the
American
Physical
Society
Two
new
attempts
in
the
mid
s
brought
the
problem
back
to
Earth
French
physicist
Hippolyte
Fizeau
set
a
beam
of
light
on
a
rapidly
rotating
toothed
wheel
with
a
mirror
set
up
miles
km
away
to
reflect
it
back
to
its
source
Varying
the
speed
of
the
wheel
allowed
Fizeau
to
calculate
how
long
it
took
for
the
light
to
travel
out
of
the
hole
to
the
adjacent
mirror
and
back
through
the
gap
Another
French
physicist
Leon
Foucault
used
a
rotating
mirror
rather
than
a
wheel
to
perform
essentially
the
same
experiment
The
two
independent
methods
each
came
within
about
miles
per
second
km
s
of
the
speed
of
light

Another
scientist
who
tackled
the
speed
of
light
mystery
was
Poland
born
Albert
A
Michelson
who
grew
up
in
California
during
the
state
s
gold
rush
period
and
honed
his
interest
in
physics
while
attending
the
U
S
Naval
Academy
according
to
the
University
of
Virginia
In
he
attempted
to
replicate
Foucault
s
method
of
determining
the
speed
of
light
but
Michelson
increased
the
distance
between
mirrors
and
used
extremely
high
quality
mirrors
and
lenses
Michelson
s
result
of
miles
per
second
km
s
was
accepted
as
the
most
accurate
measurement
of
the
speed
of
light
for
years
until
Michelson
re
measured
it
himself
In
his
second
round
of
experiments
Michelson
flashed
lights
between
two
mountain
tops
with
carefully
measured
distances
to
get
a
more
precise
estimate
And
in
his
third
attempt
just
before
his
death
in
according
to
the
Smithsonian
s
Air
and
Space
magazine
he
built
a
mile
long
depressurized
tube
of
corrugated
steel
pipe
The
pipe
simulated
a
near
vacuum
that
would
remove
any
effect
of
air
on
light
speed
for
an
even
finer
measurement
which
in
the
end
was
just
slightly
lower
than
the
accepted
value
of
the
speed
of
light
today
Michelson
also
studied
the
nature
of
light
itself
wrote
astrophysicist
Ethan
Siegal
in
the
Forbes
science
blog
Starts
With
a
Bang
The
best
minds
in
physics
at
the
time
of
Michelson
s
experiments
were
divided
Was
light
a
wave
or
a
particle
Michelson
along
with
his
colleague
Edward
Morley
worked
under
the
assumption
that
light
moved
as
a
wave
just
like
sound
And
just
as
sound
needs
particles
to
move
Michelson
and
Morley
and
other
physicists
of
the
time
reasoned
light
must
have
some
kind
of
medium
to
move
through
This
invisible
undetectable
stuff
was
called
the
luminiferous
aether
also
known
as
ether
Though
Michelson
and
Morley
built
a
sophisticated
interferometer
a
very
basic
version
of
the
instrument
used
today
in
LIGO
facilities
Michelson
could
not
find
evidence
of
any
kind
of
luminiferous
aether
whatsoever
Light
he
determined
can
and
does
travel
through
a
vacuum
The
experiment
and
Michelson
s
body
of
work
was
so
revolutionary
that
he
became
the
only
person
in
history
to
have
won
a
Nobel
Prize
for
a
very
precise
non
discovery
of
anything
Siegal
wrote
The
experiment
itself
may
have
been
a
complete
failure
but
what
we
learned
from
it
was
a

Special

Einstein
s
theory
of
special
relativity
unified
energy
matter
and
the
speed
of
light
in
a
famous
equation
E
mc
The
equation
describes
the
relationship
between
mass
and
energy
small
amounts
of
mass
m
contain
or
are
made
up
of
an
inherently
enormous
amount
of
energy
E
That
s
what
makes
nuclear
bombs
so
powerful
They
re
converting
mass
into
blasts
of
energy
Because
energy
is
equal
to
mass
times
the
speed
of
light
squared
the
speed
of
light
serves
as
a
conversion
factor
explaining
exactly
how
much
energy
must
be
within
matter
And
because
the
speed
of
light
is
such
a
huge
number
even
small
amounts
of
mass
must
equate
to
vast
quantities
of
energy
To
accurately
describe
the
universe
Einstein
s
elegant
equation
requires
the
speed
of
light
to
be
an
immutable
constant
Einstein
asserted
that
light
moved
through
a
vacuum
not
any
kind
of
luminiferous
aether
and
in
such
a
way
that
it
moved
at
the
same
speed
no
matter
the
speed
of
the
observer
Think
of
it
like
this
Observers
sitting
on
a
train
could
look
at
a
train
moving
along
a
parallel
track
and
think
of
its
relative
movement
to
themselves
as
zero
But
observers
moving
nearly
the
speed
of
light
would
still
perceive
light
as
moving
away
from
them
at
more
than
million
mph
That
s
because
moving
really
really
fast
is
one
of
the
only
confirmed
methods
of
time
travel
time
actually
slows
down
for
those
observers
who
will
age
slower
and
perceive
fewer
moments
than
an
observer
moving
slowly
In
other
words
Einstein
proposed
that
the
speed
of
light
doesn
t
vary
with
the
time
or
place
that
you
measure
it
or
how
fast
you
yourself
are
moving
Therefore
objects
with
mass
cannot
ever
reach
the
speed
of
light
If
an
object
ever
did
reach
the
speed
of
light
its
mass
would
become
infinite
And
as
a
result
the
energy
required
to
move
the
object
would
also
become
infinite
an
impossibility
That
means
if
we
base
our
understanding
of
physics
on
special
relativity
which
most
modern
physicists
do
the
speed
of
light
is
the
immutable
speed
limit
of
our
universe
the
fastest
that
anything
can
travel
What
goes
faster
than
the
speed
of
light
Although
the
speed
of
light
is
often
referred
to
as
the
universe
s
speed
limit
the
universe
actually
expands
even
faster
The
universe
expands
at
a
little
more
than
miles
kilometers
per
second
for
each
megaparsec
of
distance
from
the
observer
wrote
astrophysicist
Paul
Sutter
in
a
previous
article
for
Space
com
A
megaparsec
is
million
light
years
a
really
long
way
In
other
words
a
galaxy
megaparsec
away
appears
to
be
traveling
away
from
the
Milky
Way
at
a
speed
of
miles
per
second
km
s
while
a
galaxy
two
megaparsecs
away
recedes
at
nearly
miles
per
second
km
s
and
so
on
At
some
point
at
some
obscene
distance
the
speed
tips
over
the
scales
and
exceeds
the
speed
of
light
all
from
the
natural
regular
expansion
of
space
Sutter
explained
It
seems
like
it
should
be
illegal
doesn
t
it
Special
relativity
provides
an
absolute
speed
limit
within
the
universe
according
to
Sutter
but
Einstein
s
theory
regarding
general
relativity
allows
different
behavior
when
the
physics
you
re
examining
are
no
longer
local
A
galaxy
on
the
far
side
of
the
universe
That
s
the
domain
of
general
relativity
and
general
relativity
says
Who
cares
That
galaxy
can
have
any
speed
it
wants
as
long
as
it
stays
way
far
away
and
not
up
next
to
your
face
Sutter
wrote
Special
relativity
doesn
t
care
about
the
speed
superluminal
or
otherwise
of
a
distant
galaxy
And
neither
should
you
Does
light
ever
slow
down

Light
moves
more
slowly
when

than

it
moves

slightly
slower
than
it
can

Light
in
a
vacuum
is
generally
held
to
travel
at
an
absolute
speed
but
light
traveling
through
any
material
can
be
slowed
down
The
amount
that
a
material
slows
down
light
is
called
its
refractive
index
Light
bends
when
coming
into
contact
with
particles
which
results
in
a
decrease
in
speed
For
example
light
traveling
through
Earth
s
atmosphere
moves
almost
as
fast
as
light
in
a
vacuum
slowing
down
by
just
three
ten
thousandths
of
the
speed
of
light
But
light
passing
through
a
diamond
slows
to
less
than
half
its
typical
speed
PBS
NOVA
reported
Even
so
it
travels
through
the
gem
at
over
million
mph
almost
km
s
enough
to
make
a
difference
but
still
incredibly
fast
Light
can
be
trapped
and
even
stopped
inside
ultra
cold
clouds
of
atoms
according
to
a
study
published
in
the
journal
Nature
More
recently
a
study
published
in
the
journal
Physical
Review
Letters
proposed
a
new
way
to
stop
light
in
its
tracks
at
exceptional
points
or
places
where
two
separate
light
emissions
intersect
and
merge
into
one
Researchers
have
also
tried
to
slow
down
light
even
when
it
s
traveling
through
a
vacuum
A
team
of
Scottish
scientists
successfully
slowed
down
a
single
photon
or
particle
of
light
even
as
it
moved
through
a
vacuum
as
described
in
their
study
published
in
the
journal
Science
In
their
measurements
the
difference
between
a
slowed
photon
and
a
regular
photon
was
just
a
few
millionths
of
a
meter
but
it
demonstrated
that
light
in
a
vacuum
can
be
slower
than
the
official
speed
of
light
Can
we

Why

Science
fiction
loves
the
idea
of
warp
speed
Faster
than
light
travel
makes
countless
sci
fi
franchises
possible
condensing
the
vast
expanses
of
space
and
letting
characters
pop
back
and
forth
between
star
systems
with
ease
But
while
faster
than
light
travel
isn
t
guaranteed
impossible
we
d
need
to
harness
some
pretty
exotic
physics
to
make
it
work
Luckily
for
sci
fi
enthusiasts
and
theoretical
physicists
alike
there
are
lots
of
avenues
to
explore
All
we
have
to
do
is
figure
out
how
to
not
move
ourselves
since
special
relativity
would
ensure
we
d
be
long
destroyed
before
we
reached
high
enough
speed
but
instead
move
the
space
around
us
Easy
right
One
proposed
idea
involves
a
spaceship
that
could
fold
a
space
time
bubble
around
itself
Sounds
great
both
in
theory
and
in
fiction
If
Captain
Kirk
were
constrained
to
move
at
the
speed
of
our
fastest
rockets
it
would
take
him
a
hundred
thousand
years
just
to
get
to
the
next
star
system
said
Seth
Shostak
an

at
the
Search

Intelligence
SETI
Institute
in
Mountain
View
California
in
a
interview
with

com
s
sister

LiveScience
So
science
fiction
has
long
postulated
a
way
to
beat
the
speed
of
light
barrier
so
the
story
can
move
a
little
more
quickly
Without
faster
than
light
travel
any
Star
Trek
or
Star
War
for
that
matter
would
be
impossible
If
humanity
is
ever
to
reach
the
farthest
and
constantly
expanding
corners
of
our
universe
it
will
be
up
to
future
physicists
to
boldly
go

no

Refraction
is
the
bending
of
the
path
of
a
light
wave
as
it
passes
across
the
boundary
separating
two
media
Refraction
is
caused
by
the
change
in
speed
experienced
by
a
wave
when
it
changes
medium
Lesson
focused
on
the
topics
of
What
causes
refraction
and
Which
direction
does
light
refract
In
that
lesson
we
learned
that
light
can
either
refract
towards
the
normal
when
slowing
down
while
crossing
the
boundary
or
away
from
the
normal
when
speeding
up
while
crossing
the
boundary
The
focus
of
Lesson
is
upon
the
question
of
By
how
much
does
light
refract
when
it
crosses
a
boundary
In
the
first
part
of
Lesson
we
learned
that
a
comparison
of
the
angle
of
refraction
to
the
angle
of
incidence
provides
a
good
measure
of
the
refractive
ability
of
any
given
boundary
The
more
that
light
refracts
the
bigger
the
difference
between
these
two
angles
In
this
part
of
Lesson
we
will
learn
about
a
mathematical
equation
relating
these
two
angles
and
the
indices
of
refraction
of
the
two
materials
on
each
side
of
the
boundary

A
Lesson
from
the
Laboratory
To
begin
consider
a
hemi
cylindrical
dish
filled
with
water
Suppose
that
a
laser
beam
is
directed
towards
the
flat
side
of
the
dish
at
the
exact
center
of
the
dish
The
angle
of
incidence
can
be
measured
at
the
point
of
incidence
This
ray
will
refract
bending
towards
the
normal
since
the
light
is
passing
from
a
medium
in
which
it
travels
fast
into
one
in
which
it
travels
slow
FST
Once
the
light
ray
enters
the
water
it
travels
in
a
straight
line
until
it
reaches
the
second
boundary
At
the
second
boundary
the
light
ray
is
approaching
along
the
normal
to
the
curved
surface
this
stems
from
the
geometry
of
circles
The
ray
does
not
refract
upon
exiting
since
the
angle
of
incidence
is
degrees
recall
the
If
I
Were
An
Archer
Fish
page
The
ray
of
laser
light
therefore
exits
at
the
same
angle
as
the
refracted
ray
of
light
made
at
the
first
boundary
These
two
angles
can
be
measured
and
recorded
The
angle
of
incidence
of
the
laser
beam
can
be
changed
to
degrees
and
new
measurements
can
be
made
and
recorded
This
process
can
be
repeated
until
a
complete
data
set
of
accurate
values
has
been
collected
The
data
below
show
a
representative
set
of
data
for
such
an
experiment
Angle
of
Incidence
degrees
Angle
of
Refraction
degrees
An
inspection
of
the
data
above
reveals
that
there
is
no
clear
linear
relationship
between
the
angle
of
incidence
and
the
angle
of
refraction
For
example
a
doubling
of
the
angle
of
incidence
from
degrees
to
degrees
does
not
result
in
a
doubling
of
the
angle
of
refraction
Thus
a
plot
of
this
data
would
not
yield
a
straight
line
If
however
the
sine
of
the
angle
of
incidence
and
the
sine
of
the
angle
of
refraction
were
plotted
the
plot
would
be
a
straight
line
indicating
a
linear
relationship
between
the
sines
of
the
important
angles
If
two
quantities
form
a
straight
line
on
a
graph
then
a
mathematical
relationship
can
be
written
in
y
m
x
b
form
A
plot
of
the
sine
of
the
angle
of
incidence
vs
the
sine
of
the
angle
of
refraction
is
shown
below
u
l
b
gif
The
equation
relating
the
angles
of
incidence
i
and
the
angle
of
refraction
r
for
light
passing
from
air
into
water
is
given
as
u
l
b
gif
Observe
that
the
constant
of
proportionality
in
this
equation
is
the
index
of
refraction
value
of
water
Perhaps
it
s
just
a
coincidence
But
if
the
semi
cylindrical
dish
full
of
water
was
replaced
by
a
semi
cylindrical
disk
of
Plexiglas
the
constant
of
proportionality
would
be
the
index
of
refraction
value
of
Plexiglas
This
is
not
just
a
coincidence
The
same
pattern
would
result
for
light
traveling
from
air
into
any
material
Experimentally
it
is
found
that
for
a
ray
of
light
traveling
from
air
into
some
material
the
following
equation
can
be
written
u
l
b
gif
where
n
material
index

the

This
study
of
the
refraction
of
light
as
it
crosses
from
one
material
into
a
second
material
yields
a
general
relationship
between
the
sines
of
the
angle
of
incidence
and
the
angle
of
refraction
This
general
relationship
is
expressed
by

This

between

and
refraction
and
the
indices
of
refraction
of
the
two
media
is
known
as
Snell

Law
Snell
s
law
applies
to
the
refraction
of
light
in

situation
regardless
of
what

An
Angle
Value
As
with
any
equation
in
physics
the
Snell

equation
is

for
its

ability
If
any

the

in

are
known
the
fourth
variable
can
be
predicted
if
appropriate
problem

employed

is

the
two

Laser
light
is
shown
passing
into
and
out
of
a
hemi
cylindrical
dish
filled
with
water
The
light
enters
the
water
at
the
curved
side
of
the
dish
along
the
normal
line
no
bending
occurs
upon
entry
The
light
continues
through
the
water
along
a
straight
line
until
it
reaches
the
boundary
with
air
at
the
flat
side
of
the
dish
The
angle
of
incidence
in
the
water
is
approximately
At
this
angle
the
light
refracts
out
of
the
water
into
the
surrounding
air
bending
away
from
the
normal
The
angle
of
refraction
in
the
air
is
approximately
These
values
for
the
angle
of
incidence
and
refraction
are
consistent
with
Snell

The
Verdict
When
it
comes
to
choosing
the
perfect
weights
for
your
sets
the
heavier
the
better
right
Surely
there
s
no
point
in
reaching
for
lighter
weights
if
your
goal
is
to
gain
as
much
muscle
as
possible
While
swinging
the
heaviest
dumbbells
may
seem
like
the
fastest
track
to
gym
cred
it
s
well
known
that
cheating
your
reps
may
not
be
the
most
optimal
path
to
hypertrophy
Plus
if
you
want
to
build
explosive
power
shortchanging
yourself
with
your
weight
choice
isn
t
going
to
cut
it
So
which
is
best
MH
breaks
down
the
latest
research
and
how
it
relates
to
your
training
goals
so
that
you
can

the

you
want
What
to

next
Is
It
Better
to
Do
Heavy
or
Light
Weights
Whether
you
choose
to
use
heavy
weights
with
low
reps
or
light
weights
with
high
reps
will
comes
down
to
a
few
considerations
Your

Muscle
growth
strength
or
endurance

Beginner
intermediate
or
advanced
Your

What
you
enjoy

the
most
Current

frequency
This
will
effect
your
capacity
to
recover
in

or
past
injuries
This
will

the
load
at
which
you
can

and
your
exercise
selection

Can
You
Build
Muscle
with
Light
Weights
High
Reps
You
can
build
muscle
with
a
variety
of
rep
ranges
and
weight
choices
The
most
important
factor
is
the
proximity
to
failure
Researchers
in
a
study
published
by
PeerJ
set
out
to
find
out
what
exactly
happens
when
there
is
a
focus
on
increasing
reps
versus
load
to
facilitate
progressive
overload
They
concluded
that
increasing
repetitions
and
load
both
appear
to
be
good
strategies
for
increasing
muscle
mass
Can
You
Build
Muscle
with
Heavy
Weights
Low
Reps
A
study
published
in
the
Journal
of
Strength
and
Conditioning
Research
compares
high
reps
with
lower
weights
to
lower
reps
with
higher
weights
with
both
groups
working
to
failure
The
study
found
that
the
muscle
size
results
for
both
groups
were
similar
However
for
strength
gains
the
subjects
using
higher
weights
and
lower
reps
saw
the
most
benefit
When
it
comes
to
gaining
muscle
as
long
as
you
re
working
close
to
failure
the
weight
you
choose
becomes
less
important
What
is
most
crucial
for
muscle
gains
is
proximity
to
failure
Pushing
ourselves
to
within
reps
of
failure
should
be
sufficient
Another
study
published
in
Sports
Medicine
confirms
this
The
meta
analysis
aimed
to
investigate
the
relationship
between
estimated
proximity
to
failure
reps
in
reserve
during
resistance
training
with
two
main
focuses
strength
gains
and
muscle
hypertrophy
The
study
concluded
that
for
strength
it
is
more
important
to
focus
on
heavier
loads
however
not
working
to
failure
For
muscle
growth
it
showed
that
working
closer
to
failure
was
beneficial
for
muscle
growth

Do
Bodybuilders
Lift
Heavy
or
Light
Bodybuilders
will
predominantly
work
with
higher
rep
ranges
and
lighter
moderate
weights
However
many
will
work
with
a
variety
of
rep
ranges
and
weights
in
order
to
build
muscle
mass
and
strength
Many
bodybuilders
tend
to
do
cutting
and
bulking
phases
If
they
are
in
a
cutting
phase
fat
loss
calorie
deficit
phase
working
with
higher
reps
and
lighter
weights
is
preferential
due
to
the
reduced
neurological
impact
compared
to
heavier
weights
They
are
usually
starting
sessions
with
a
higher
level
of
fatigue
which
would
mean
lighter
weights
would
be
more
suitable
while
still
increasing
hypertrophy
When
they
are
in
a
bulking
phase
muscle
gain
calorie
surplus
phase
they
will
tend
to
include
more
heavy
lifts
with
lower
rep
ranges
when
they
are
training
with
high
energy
levels
The
Verdict
For
Hypertrophy
Both
lighter
weights
with
higher
reps
and
heavier
weights
with
lower
reps
increase
muscle
mass
What
is
most
important
is
the
proximity
to
failure
in
which
you
work
at
the
end
of
your
sets
While
you
don
t
have
to
work
to
failure
working
close
is
ideal
Aim
for
reps
per
set
and
to
finish
your
sets
reps
short
of
failure
For
Strength
For
strength
it
is
more
important
to
focus
on
heavier
loads
This
is
because
heavier
weights
recruit
more
muscular
motor
units
and
contribute
to
greater
strength
gains
However
you
don
t
have
to
work
to
failure
Training
to
failure
can
be
very
demanding
on
the
body
and
more
difficult
to
recover
from
in
subsequent
sets
With
varied
evidence
showing
strength
improvements
from
working
close
to
failure
we
can
assume
that
aiming
for
reps
per
set
and
finishing
reps
short
of
failure
is
the
sweet
spot
for
strength
training
while
also
mitigating
risks

Photon
discovery
Although
physicists
have
studied
the
nature
of
light
for
centuries
arguments
went
back
and
forth
as
to
whether
light
was
made
of
tiny
particles
or
was
wave
like
in
nature
In
the
late
s
however
the
pioneering
work
of
German
physicist
Max
Planck
changed
the
entire
picture

principle
without

Planck
was
studying
something
called
blackbody
radiation
or
light
from
a
special
device
that
emitted
light
at
all
frequencies
as
efficiently
as
possible
Until
Planck
nobody
could
explain
the
spectrum
of
light
coming
from
these
devices
so
Planck
added
a
fix
to
the
equations
By
assuming
that
light
could
be
emitted
only
in
discrete
chunks
of
energy
known
as
quanta
he
was
able
to
develop
a
formula
that
perfectly
explained
the
blackbody
spectra
according
to
HyperPhysics
Physicists
weren
t
exactly
sure
what
to
make
of
Planck
s
result
but
several
years
later
Albert
Einstein
took
it
one
step
further
To
explain
the
photoelectric
effect
which
is
the
release
of
electrons
from
a
metal
when
light
shines
on
it
Einstein
proposed
that
light
itself
is
composed
of
discrete
little
chunks
according
to
the
American
Physical
Society
Over
time
those
little
chunks
became
known
as
photons
The
work
of
Planck
Einstein
and
others
to
study
the
nature
of
light
kick
started
the
development
of
quantum
mechanics

Are
photons
particles
Strictly
speaking
photons
are
neither
particles
nor
waves
they
are
a
combination
of
both
In
some
situations
their
particle
like
nature
comes
out
more
and
in
others
their
wave
like
nature
is
more
apparent

For
example
a
detector
can
register
the
arrival
of
a
single
photon
which
appears
as
a
point
like
particle
The
process
known
as
Compton
scattering
involves
a
photon
striking
an
electron
and
in
that
situation
the
photon
acts
as
a
particle
However
it
s
impossible
to
predict
exactly
where
or
when
a
photon
will
strike
a
detector
In
quantum
mechanics
one
can
only
assign
probabilities
to
events
Those
events
are
modeled
by
equations
for
waves
with
peaks
in
the
waves
corresponding
to
regions
of
high
probability
of
receiving
a
photon
and
troughs
corresponding
to
regions
of
low
probability
according
to
AccessScience
by
McGraw
Hill
This
concept
is
best
exemplified
by
the
famous
double
slit
experiment
which
solidified
the
dual
wave
particle
nature
of
light
and
eventually
other
subatomic
particles
When
light
passes
through
a
screen
with
two
slits
cut
into
it
it
forms
an
interference
pattern
on
the
detector
on
the
other
side
of
the
screen
where
the
peaks
of
waves
line
up
with
each
other
in
some
places
and
where
the
peaks
and
troughs
cancel
each
other
out
in
others
Even
though
only
one
photon
passes
through
the
screen
at
a
time
with
each
individual
photon
acting
like
a
particle
the
interference
pattern
that
emerges
on
the
detector
is
the
exact
same
pattern
that
would
occur
if
waves
were
passing
through
the
slits
instead

Do
photons
have
mass
and
momentum
Photons
have
zero
mass
which
allows
them
to
travel
at
the
fastest
possible
speed
in
the
universe
the
speed
of
light
However
they
do
have
energy
and
momentum
The
energy
of
a
photon
is
given
by
Planck
s
constant
times
the
frequency
of
the
light
and
the
momentum
of
a
photon
is
given
by
Planck
s
constant
times
the
frequency
of
the
light
times
the
speed
of
light
according
to
the
University
of
Calgary
s
Energy
Education
website
The
fact
that
photons
have
momentum
enables
a
broad
array
of
applications
For
example
solar
sails
are
experimental
propulsion
devices
that
use
sunlight
to
push
a
spacecraft
According
to
NASA
the
photons
from
the
sun
bounce
off
of
the
reflecting
sail
thus
imparting
their
momentum
on
the
sail
and
moving
the
spacecraft
Do
photons
experience
time
Our
understanding
of
the
rate
of
the
passage
of
time
comes
from
Einstein
s
theory
of
special
relativity
which
states
that
objects
traveling
closer
and
closer
to
the
speed
of
light
will
experience
slower
and
slower
rates
of
the
passage
of
time
In
other
words
moving
clocks
run
slowly
according
to
John
D
Horton
of
the
University
of
Pittsburgh
However
the
mathematics
of
special
relativity
apply
only
to
objects
traveling
more
slowly
than
the
speed
of
light
and
don
t
apply
directly
to
photons
which
do
travel
at
the
speed
of
light
Thus
it
s
impossible
to
say
what
a
photon
experiences
in
terms
of
the
flow
of
time
because
scientists
have
no
mathematical
language
to
support
it
Another
way
to
put
this
is
that
the
concept
of
the
flow
of
time
is
meaningless
to
photons
Are
photons
affected
by
gravity

Because

Under

of

which
is
our

anything

Specifically
massless
particles
such
as

which
are
paths

one
point
to

according
to
EarthSky
In
general

due
to
the

of
massive

This
can
make
the

a

just
as
jets
have
to

to
go
straight
from

because
Earth

The

time
affects
photons
in
several
ways
When
photons
are
moving
from
a
region
of
strong
gravity
to
a
region
of
weaker
gravity
they
will
lose
energy
which
lowers
their
frequencies
to
the
redder
end
of
the
spectrum
When

near
massive
objects
their
direction
of
motion
will

An
aurora
is
a
natural
light
display
that
shimmers
in
the
sky
Blue
red
yellow
green
and
orange
lights
shift
gently
and
change
shape
like
softly
blowing
curtains
Auroras
are
only
visible
at
night
and
usually
only
appear
in
lower
polar
regions
Auroras
are
visible
almost
every
night
near
the
Arctic
and
Antarctic
Circles
which
are
about
degrees
north
and
south
of
the
Equator
In
the
north
the
display
is
called
aurora
borealis
or
northern
lights
In
the
south
it
is
called
aurora
australis
or
southern
lights
Auroras
and
the
Solar
Wind
The
activity
that
creates
auroras
begins
on
the
sun
The
sun
is
a
ball
of
superhot
gases
made
of
electrically
charged
particles
called
ions
The
ions
which
continuously
stream
from
the
sun
s
surface
are
called
the
solar
wind
As
solar
wind
approaches
Earth
it
meets
Earth
s
magnetic
field
Without
this
magnetic
field
protecting
the
planet
the
solar
wind
would
blow
away
Earth
s
fragile
atmosphere
preventing
all
life
Most
of
the
solar
wind
is
blocked
by
the
magnetosphere
and
the
ions
forced
around
the
planet
continue
to
travel
farther
into
the
solar
system
Although
most
of
the
solar
wind
is
blocked
by
the
magnetosphere
some
of
the
ions
become
briefly
trapped
in
ring
shaped
holding
areas
around
the
planet
These
areas
in
a
region
of
the
atmosphere
called
the
ionosphere
are
centered
around
Earth
s
geomagnetic
poles
The
geomagnetic
poles
mark
the
tilted
axis
of
Earth
s
magnetic
field
They
lie
about
kilometers
miles
from
the
geographic
poles
but
are
slowly
moving
In
the
ionosphere
the
ions
of
the
solar
wind
collide
with
atoms
of
oxygen
and
nitrogen
from
Earth
s
atmosphere
The
energy
released
during
these
collisions
causes
a
colorful
glowing
halo
around
the
poles
an
aurora
Most
auroras
happen
about
kilometers
miles
above
Earth
s
surface
The
most
active
auroras
happen
when
the
solar
wind
is
the
strongest
The
solar
wind
is
usually
fairly
constant
but
solar
weather
the
heating
and
cooling
of
different
parts
of
the
sun
can
change
daily
Solar
weather
is
often
measured
in
sunspots
Sunspots
are
the
coldest
part
of
the
sun
and
appear
as
dark
blobs
on
its
white
hot
surface
Solar
flares
and
coronal
mass
ejections
are
associated
with
sunspots
Solar

ejections
are
sudden
extra
bursts
of
energy
in
the
solar
wind
Sunspot
activity
is
tracked
over
an
year
cycle
Bright
consistent
auroras
are
most
visible
during
the
height
of
sunspot
activity
Some
increased
activity
in
the
solar
wind
happens
during
every
equinox
These
regular
fluctuations
are
known
as
magnetic
storms
Magnetic
storms
can
lead
to
auroras
being
seen
in
the
midlatitudes
during
the
time
around
the
spring
and
autumnal
equinoxes
Auroras
have
been
visible
as
far
south
as
the
Yucatan
Peninsula
in
Mexico
Magnetic
storms
and
active
auroras
can
sometimes
interfere
with
communications
They
can
disrupt
radio
and
radar
signals
Intense
magnetic
storms
can
even
disable
communication
satellites
Coloring
an
Aurora
The
colors
of
the
aurora
vary
depending
on
altitude
and
the
kind
of
atoms
involved
If
ions
strike
oxygen
atoms
high
in
the
atmosphere
the
interaction
produces
a
red
glow
This
is
an
unusual
aurora
the
most
familiar
display
a
green
yellow
hue
occurs
as
ions
strike
oxygen
at
lower
altitudes
Reddish
and
bluish
light
that
often
appears
in
the
lower
fringes
of
auroras
is
produced
by
ions
striking
atoms
of
nitrogen
Ions
striking
hydrogen
and
helium
atoms
can
produce
blue
and
purple
auroras
although
our
eyes
can
rarely
detect
this
part
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
To
find
out
more
about
the
mysterious
light
displays
scientists
have
launched
satellites
specially
designed
to
study
auroras
Until
NASA

Global

satellite
used
ultraviolet
and

to
study
auroras
and
how
they
are
formed
Fast
Fact
Dawn
Wind
The
aurora
borealis
or
northern
lights
was
studied
by
ancient
Roman
and
Greek
astronomers
The
phenomenon
was
named
for
the
Roman
goddess
of
the
dawn
Aurora
and
the
Greek
god
of
the
north
wind
Boreas
Fast
Fact
Fox
Fire
In
Finland
the
aurora
borealis
is
called
revontulet
which
literally
translates
to
fox
fires
According
to
one
Finnish
folk
tale
the
lights
are
caused
by
a
magical
fox
sweeping
his
tail
across
the
snow
and
sending
sparks
up
into
the
sky

The

heard
for

What
is
red
shift

ESA
Science
Exploration

Science
Red
shift
is
a
key
concept
for
astronomers
The
term
can
be
understood
literally
the
wavelength
of
the
light
is
stretched
so
the
light
is
seen
as
shifted
towards
the
red
part
of
the
spectrum
Something
similar
happens
to
sound
waves
when
a
source
of
sound
moves
relative
to
an
observer
This
effect
is
called
the
Doppler
effect
after
Christian
Andreas
Doppler
an
Austrian
mathematician
who
discovered
that
the
frequency
of
sound
waves
changes
if
the
source
of
sound
and
the
observer
are
moving
relative
to
each
other
If
the
two
are
approaching
then
the
frequency
heard
by
the
observer
is
higher
if
they
move
away
from
each
other
the
frequency
heard
is
lower
There
are
many
everyday
examples
of
the
Doppler
effect
the
changing
pitch
of
police
and
ambulance
sirens
or
train
whistles
and
racing
car
engines
as
they
pass
by
In
every
case
there
is
an
audible
change
in
pitch
as
the
source
approaches
and
then
passes
an
observer
Everyone
has
heard
the
increased
pitch
of
an
approaching
police
siren
and
the
sharp
decrease
in
pitch
as
the
siren
passes
by
and
recedes
The
effect
arises
because
the
sound
waves
arrive
at
the
listener
s
ear
closer
together
as
the
source
approaches
and
further
apart
as
it
recedes
Light
behaves
like
a
wave
so
light
from
a
luminous
object
undergoes
a
Doppler
like
shift
if
the
source
is
moving
relative
to
us
Ever
since
when
Edwin
Hubble
discovered
that
the
Universe
is
expanding
we
have
known
that
most
other
galaxies
are
moving
away
from
us
Light
from
these
galaxies
is
shifted
to
longer
and
this
means
redder
wavelengths
in
other
words
it
is
red
shifted
Since
light
travels
at
such
a
great
speed
relative
to
everyday
phenomena
a
million
times
faster
than
sound
we
do
not
experience
this
red
shift
in
our
daily
lives
The
red
shift
of
a
distant
galaxy
or
quasar
is
easily
measured
by
comparing
its
spectrum
with
a
reference
laboratory
spectrum
Atomic
emission
and
absorption
lines
occur
at
well
known
wavelengths
By
measuring
the
location
of
these
lines
in
astronomical
spectra
astronomers
can
determine
the
red
shift
of
the
receding
sources
However
to
be
accurate
the
red
shifts
observed
in
distant
objects
are
not
exactly
due
to
the
Doppler
phenomenon
but
are
rather
a
result
of
the
expansion
of
the
Universe
Doppler
shifts
arise
from
the
relative
motion
of
source
and
observer
through
space
whereas
astronomical
redshifts
are
expansion
redshifts
due
to
the
expansion
of
space
itself
Two
objects
can
actually
be
stationary
in
space
and
still
experience
a
red
shift
if
the
intervening
space
itself
is
expanding
A
convenient
analogy
for
the
expansion
of
the
Universe
is
a
loaf
of
unbaked
raisin
bread
The
raisins
are
at
rest
relative
to
one
another
in
the
dough
before
it
is
placed
in
the
oven
As
the
bread
rises
it
also
expands
making
the
space
between
the
raisins
increase
If
the
raisins
could
see
they
would
observe
that
all
the
other
raisins
were
moving
away
from
them
although
they
themselves
were
stationary
within
the
loaf
Only
the
dough
their
Universe
is
expanding

What
is
light
pollution
Definition
of
light
pollution
Light
pollution
is
the
human
made
alteration
of
outdoor
light
levels
from
those
occurring
naturally
When
we
over
light
fail
to
use
timers
and
sensors
or
use
the
wrong
color
of
light
we
can
negatively
affect
many
parts
of
our
world
including
migratory
birds
pollinators
sea
turtles
and
mammals
including
humans
Light
can
be
a
pollutant
Most
of
us
are
familiar
with
air
pollution
water
pollution
and
land
pollution
but
did
you
know
that
light
can
also
be
a
pollutant
Components
of
light
pollution
include
Glare
excessive
brightness
that
causes
visual
discomfort
Sky
glow
brightening
of
the
night
sky
over
inhabited
areas
Light
trespass
light
falling
where
it
is
not
intended
or
needed
Clutter
bright
confusing
and
excessive
groupings
of
light
sources
What
causes
light
pollution
Light
pollution
is
a
side
effect
of
industrial
civilization
Its
sources
include
building
exterior
and
interior
lighting
advertising
commercial
properties
offices
factories
streetlights

How
bad
is
light
pollution
With
much
of
the
Earth
s
population
living
under
light
polluted
skies
overlighting
is
an
international
concern
If
you
live
in
an
urban
or
suburban
area
all
you
have
to
do
to
see
this
type
of
pollution
is
go
outside
at
night
and
look
up
at
the
sky
How
many
stars
can
you
see
According
to
the
groundbreaking
World
Atlas
of
Artificial
Night

affects
every

Fortunately
concern
about
light
pollution
is
rising
dramatically
A
growing
number
of
scientists
homeowners
environmental
groups
and
civic
leaders
are
taking
action
to
restore
the
natural
night
The
good
news
is
that
light
pollution
unlike
many
other
forms
of
pollution
is
reversible
and
each
one
of
us
can
make
a
difference
Just
being
aware
that
light

is
a
problem
is
not
enough
we
need
to
take
action

What
is
a
light
year
Posted
by
Christopher
Crockett
and
February
A
light
year
is
how
astronomers
measure
distance
in
space
It
s
defined
by
how
far
a
beam
of
light
travels
in
one
year
a
distance
of
six
trillion
miles
Think
of
it
as
the
bigger
badder
cousin
of
the
inch
the
mile
the
kilometer
and
the
furlong
If
you
like
to
keep
up
with
what
s
going
on
in
astronomy
it
s
worth
spending
a
little
bit
of
time
understanding
what
the
deal
is
with
this
funny
unit
of
measurement
Astronomers
use
a
beam
of
light
as
their
reference
to
finding
distances
to
space
objects

Have
you
ever
been
on
your
way
to
meet
some
friends
and
while
en
route
called
to
tell
them
you
re
running
late
If
you
re
like
me
you
might
tell
them
I
m
about
ten
minutes
away
You
re
using
how
long
it
will
take
you
to
get
there
as
a
substitute
for
how
far
away
you
are
Astronomers
do
the
same
thing
when
figuring
out
the
distance
to
a
star
or
galaxy
but
instead
of
relying
on
how
fast
they
could
drive
or
walk
they
use
a
beam
of
light
as
their
reference
Why
do
things
this
way
First
light
is
convenient
Throughout
the
universe
all
light
travels
at
exactly
the
same
speed
about
million
miles
per
hour
We
don
t
usually
think
about
light
traveling
anywhere
because
when
we
flick
on
a
light
switch
there
it
is
We
don
t
have
to
wait
for
the
room
to
light
up
It
happens
instantaneously
Except
that
it
s
not
instantaneous
just
insanely
fast
In
fact
let
s
pause
for
a
second
and
reflect
on
how
ludicrously
quick
the
speed
of
light
is
If
you
could
travel
at
the
speed
of
light
you
could
circle
the
globe
of
Earth
almost
eight
times
in
one
second

Traveling
at
that
speed
you
would
encircle
the
globe
of
Earth
almost
eight
times
in
one
second
Impressive
Certainly
faster
than
traveling
by
airplane
So
if
you
were
to
travel
off
the
Earth
in
a
straight
line
at
light
speed
you
d
get
pretty
far
in
the
same
amount
of
time
right
Actually
since
space
is
so
vast
you
wouldn
t
have
even
made
it
to
the
moon
Travel
to
the
moon
takes
about
a
second
and
a
half
at
light
speed
Travel
to
the
sun
at
light
speed
takes
about
eight
minutes
Can
you
even
imagine
Traveling
at
a
speed
where
you
cross
nearly
miles
every
second
for
eight
full
minutes
would
only
get
you
to
the
center
of
our
solar
system
A
light
beam
needs
only
minutes
to
travel
the
million
miles
million
kilometers
from
the
sun
to

The
fact
that
light
takes
time
to
get
anywhere
has
an
interesting
side
effect
If
light
from
the
sun
takes
eight
minutes
to
get
to
us
then
we
re
actually
seeing
the
sun
as
it
was
eight
minutes
ago
We
re
looking
into
the
past
While
this
sounds
a
little
crazy
it
s
actually
something
with
which
you
re
already
familiar
If
you
ve
ever
seen
fireworks
for
example
you
know
that
you
see
the
explosion
and
then
a
few
seconds
later
you
hear
it
If
you
close
your
eyes
during
the
fireworks
show
you
d
only
have
your
ears
to
know
when
things
were
happening
Since
it
takes
some
time
for
the
sound
to
get
to
you
you
d
always
be
hearing
things
a
few
seconds
after
they
happened
The
same
happens
with
light
we
only
see
something
once
the
light
from
that
event
actually
gets
to
our
eyes
When
we
re
looking
across
a
room
the
time
delay
is
only
a
few
billionths
of
a
second
But
when
we
start
looking
across
large
enough
distances
the
light
becomes
noticeably
delayed
like
the
sounds
are
from
exploding
fireworks
The
red
star
in
the
center
of
this
picture
is
Proxima
Centauri
our
sun
s
nearest
neighbor
among
the
stars
A
beam
of
light
from
this
star
takes
about
years
to
travel
to
Earth
Image

hyperphysics
phy
astr
gsu
edu
The
main
reason
for
using
light
years
however
is
because
the
distances
we
deal
with
in
space
are
immense
If
we
stick
to
miles
or
kilometers
we
quickly
run
into
unwieldy
numbers
just
measuring
the
distance
to
the
nearest
star
a
dim
red
dwarf
called
Proxima
Centauri
that
sits
a
mere
miles
away
Using
a
longer
yard
stick
so
to
speak
helps
keep
the
numbers
at
least
manageable
To
an
astronomer
the
distance
to
Proxima
Centauri
is
only
four
light
years
Put
another
way
it
takes
the
light
from
our
stellar
next
door
neighbor
four
years
to
get
to
Earth
The
Milky
Way
galaxy
in
which
our
sun
and
all
the
stars
we
see
at
night
reside
spans
light
years
from
one
end
to
the
other
Putting
that
into
perspective
the
duration
of
recorded
human
history
is
roughly
years
So
light
from
a
star
at
one
end
of
our
galaxy
takes
times
longer
than
all
of
recorded
history
to
get
to
the
other
end
Andromeda
Galaxy
Astronomers
measure
the
distance
to
the
Andromeda
galaxy
using
light
years
One
light
year
equals
about
trillion
miles
This
galaxy
is
over
million
light
years
from
Earth

Moving
beyond
our
galaxy
it
s
just
over
two
million
light
years
to
our
nearest
galactic
neighbor
the
Andromeda
galaxy
The
light
we
currently
see
from
that
galaxy
left
there
about
the
same
time
the
ancestors
of
modern
humans
were
first
discovering
stone
tools
Our
last
stop
takes
us
to
the
edge
of
the
visible
universe
It
s
also
here
where
the
trickiness
of
measuring
distance
in
an
ever
expanding
universe
becomes
apparent
The
light
we
see
coming
from
the
farthest
depths
of
the
universe
has
been
traveling
across
the
cosmos
for
almost
three
times
longer
than
our
planet
has
existed
nearly
billion
years
But
there
s
a
catch
we
cannot
say
that
the
edge
of
the
visible
universe
is
billion
light
years
away

Why
Because
the
universe
has
grown
larger
in
that
time
A
galaxy
whose
light
took
billion
years
to
reach
our
little
planet
has
in
the
intervening
aeons
moved
even
further
away
The
current
physical
distance
to
that
remote
beacon
if
we
stopped
the
universe
from
expanding
and
stretched
out
a
really
long
tape
measure
is
just
over
billion
light
years
Even
in
light
years
measuring
distances
across
the
universe
becomes
unwieldy
But
measuring
in
something
familiar
like
miles
is
truly
humbling
From
here
to
the
edge
of
our
vision
spans
a
distance
of
approximately
miles
And
it
s
getting
bigger
every
day
Bottom
line
How
far
is
a
light
year
It
s
the
distance
a
beam
of
light
travels
in
one
year
a
distance
of
six
trillion
miles

You
may
have
seen
the
sparkle
of
fireflies
on
a
summer
s
night
The
fireflies
produce
light
through
a
chemical
reaction
in
their
glowing
abdomens
a
process
known
as
bioluminescence
But
did
you
know
that
seascapes
can
also
glow
and
glitter
thanks
to
the
light
producing
abilities
of
many
marine
organisms
Some
fish
dangle
a
lighted
lure
in
front
of
their
mouths
to
attract
prey
while
some
squid
shoot
out
bioluminescent
liquid
instead
of
ink
to
confuse
their
predators
Worms
and
tiny
crustaceans
also
use
bioluminescence
to
attract
mates
Humans
primarily
see
bioluminescence
triggered
by
a
physical
disturbance
such
as
waves
or
a
moving
boat
hull
that
gets
the
animal
to
show
their
light
off
but
often
animals
light
up
in
response
to
an
attack
or
in
order
to
attract
a
mate
Bioluminescent
organisms
live
throughout
the
water
column
from
the
surface
to
the
seafloor
from
near
the
coast
to
the
open
ocean
In
the
deep
sea
bioluminescence
is
extremely
common
and
because
the
deep
sea
is
so
vast
bioluminescence
may
be
the
most
common
form
of
communication
on
the
planet
Underwater

Bioluminescence
occurs
through
a
chemical
reaction
that
produces
light
energy
within
an
organism
s
body
For
a
reaction
to
occur
a
species
must
contain
luciferin
a
molecule
that
when
it
reacts
with
oxygen
produces
light
There
are
different
types
of
luciferin
which
vary
depending
on
the
animal
hosting
the
reaction
Many
organisms
also
produce
the
catalyst
luciferase
which
helps
to
speed
up
the
reaction
Animals
can
closely
control
when
they
light
up
by
regulating
their
chemistry
and
brain
processes
depending
on
their
immediate
needs
whether
a
meal
or
a
mate
Some
organisms
even
bundle
the
luciferin
with
oxygen
in
what
is
called
a
photoprotein
like
a
pre
packaged
bioluminescence
bomb
that
is
ready
to
light
up
the
moment
a
certain
ion
typically
calcium
becomes
present
They
can
even
choose
the
intensity
and
color
of
the
lights

Bioluminescence
is
found
in
many
marine
organisms
bacteria
algae
jellyfish
worms
crustaceans
sea
stars
fish
and
sharks
to
name
just
a
few
In
fish
alone
there
are
about
known
species
that
luminesce
In
some
cases
animals
take
in
bacteria
or
other
bioluminescent
creatures
to
gain
the
ability
to
light
up
For
example
the
Hawaiian
bobtail
squid
has
a
special
light
organ
that
is
colonized
by
bioluminescent
bacteria
within
hours
of
its
birth
But
usually
the
animal
itself
contains
the
chemicals
necessary
for
the
reaction
that
produces
bioluminescence
The
number
of
species
that
bioluminesce
and
the
variations
in
the
chemical
reactions
that
produce
light
are
evidence
that
bioluminescence
has
evolved
many
times
over
at
least
separate
times
This
number
continues
to
grow
as
research
makes
new
discoveries
In
scientists
discovered
the
ray
finned
fishes
themselves
evolved
bioluminescence
separate
times
That
s
quite
an
increase
from
the
handful
of
times
that
were
known
before
Most
deep
sea
animals
produce
some
bioluminescent
light
but
the
phenomenon
isn
t
relegated
to
the
deep
one
of
the
most
common
sightings
occurs
at
the
surface
of
the
ocean
Many
small
planktonic
surface
dwellers
such
as
single
celled
dinoflagellates
are
bioluminescent
When
conditions
are
right
dinoflagellates
bloom
in
dense
layers
at
the
surface
of
the
water
causing
the
ocean
to
take
on
a
reddish
brown
color
in
daylight
and
a

Light
travels
in
waves
of
different
shapes
known
as
wavelengths
which
determine
the
color
of
the
light
When
the
waves
hit
our
eyes
they
are
translated
into
colors
by
the
brain
depending
on
their
wavelength
The
wavelengths
that
our
eyes
can
see
are
known
as
the
visible
light
spectrum
and
we
can
see
all
the
colors
on
this
spectrum
as
they
travel
through
the
air
above
land
But
light
travels
differently
underwater
because
longer
wavelengths
can
t
travel
as
far
Most
of
the
bioluminescence
produced
in
the
ocean
is
in
the
form
of
blue
green
light
This
is
because
these
colors
are
shorter
wavelengths
of
light
which
can
travel
through
and
thus
be
seen
in
both
shallow
and
deep
water
Light
traveling
from
the
sun
of
longer
wavelengths
such
as
red
light
doesn
t
reach
the
deep
sea
This
is
why
many
deep
sea
animals
are
red
it
s
effectively
the
same
as
being
invisible
Moreover
because
it
s
not
present
many
deep
water
animals
have
lost
the
ability
to
see
it
altogether
However
some
animals
evolved
to
emit
and
see
red
light
including
the
dragonfish
Malacosteus
By
creating
their
own
red
light
in
the
deep
sea
they
are
able
to
see
red
colored
prey
as
well
as
communicate
and
even
show
prey
to
other
dragonfish
while
other
unsuspecting
animals
cannot
see
their
red
lights
as
a
warning
to
flee

What
Is
Photosynthesis
Why
Is
it
Important
Most
living
things
depend
on
photosynthetic
cells
to
manufacture
the
complex
organic
molecules
they
require
as
a
source
of
energy
Photosynthetic
cells
are
quite
diverse
and
include
cells
found
in
green
plants
phytoplankton
and
cyanobacteria
During
the
process
of
photosynthesis
cells
use
carbon
dioxide
and
energy
from
the
Sun
to
make
sugar
molecules
and
oxygen
These
sugar
molecules
are
the
basis
for
more
complex
molecules
made
by
the
photosynthetic
cell
such
as
glucose
Then
via
respiration
processes
cells
use
oxygen
and
glucose
to
synthesize
energy
rich
carrier
molecules
such
as
ATP
and
carbon
dioxide
is
produced
as
a
waste
product
Therefore
the
synthesis
of
glucose
and
its
breakdown
by
cells
are
opposing
processes
A
diagram
shows
the
interactions
between
plant
soil
river
and
ocean
systems
during
the
carbon
cycle
Arrows
are
used
to
represent
storage
or
flow
of
inorganic
carbon
and
organic
carbon
or

The
building
and
breaking
of
carbon
based
material
from
carbon
dioxide
to
complex
organic
molecules
photosynthesis
then
back
to
carbon
dioxide
respiration
is
part
of
what
is
commonly
called
the
global
carbon
cycle
Indeed
the
fossil
fuels
we
use
to
power
our
world
today
are
the
ancient
remains
of
once
living
organisms
and
they
provide
a
dramatic
example
of
this
cycle
at
work
The
carbon
cycle
would
not
be
possible
without
photosynthesis
because
this
process
accounts
for
the
building
portion
of
the
cycle
Figure
However
photosynthesis
doesn
t
just
drive
the
carbon
cycle
it
also
creates
the
oxygen
necessary
for
respiring
organisms
Interestingly
although
green
plants
contribute
much
of
the
oxygen
in
the
air
we
breathe
phytoplankton
and
cyanobacteria
in
the
world
s
oceans
are
thought
to
produce
between
one
third
and
one
half
of
atmospheric
oxygen

In

Chloroplasts
are
surrounded

What
Are
the
Steps
of
Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis
consists
of
both
light
dependent
reactions
and
light
independent
reactions
In
plants
the
so
called
light
reactions
occur
within
the
chloroplast
thylakoids
where
the
aforementioned
chlorophyll
pigments
reside
When
light
energy
reaches
the
pigment
molecules
it
energizes
the
electrons
within
them
and
these
electrons
are
shunted
to
an
electron
transport
chain
in
the
thylakoid
membrane
Every
step
in
the
electron
transport
chain
then
brings
each
electron
to
a
lower
energy
state
and
harnesses
its
energy
by
producing
ATP
and
NADPH
Meanwhile
each
chlorophyll
molecule
replaces
its
lost
electron
with
an
electron
from
water
this
process
essentially
splits
water
molecules
to
produce
oxygen

Figure
The

in
the
chloroplast
The
chloroplast
is
involved
in
both
stages
of
photosynthesis
The
light
reactions
take
place
in
the
thylakoid
There
water
H
O
is
oxidized
and
oxygen
O
is
released
The
electrons
that
freed
from
the
water
are
transferred
to
ATP
and
NADPH
The
dark
reactions
then
occur
outside
the
thylakoid
In
these
reactions
the
energy
from
ATP
and
NADPH
is
used
to
fix
carbon
dioxide
CO
The
products
of
this
reaction
are
sugar
molecules
and
various
other
organic
molecules
necessary
for

function
and

also
known
as
carbon
fixation
energy
from
the
ATP
and
NADPH
molecules
generated
by
the
light
reactions
drives
a
chemical
pathway
that
uses
the
carbon
in
carbon
dioxide
from
the
atmosphere
to
build
a
three
carbon
sugar
called
glyceraldehyde
phosphate
G
P
Cells
then
use
G
P
to
build
a
wide
variety
of
other
sugars
such
as
glucose
and
organic
molecules
Many
of
these
interconversions
occur
outside
the
chloroplast
following
the
transport
of
G
P
from
the
stroma
The
products
of
these
reactions
are
then
transported
to
other
parts
of
the
cell
including
the
mitochondria
where
they
are
broken
down
to
make
more
energy
carrier
molecules
to
satisfy
the
metabolic
demands
of
the
cell
In
plants
some
sugar
molecules
are
stored
as
sucrose
or
starch
Conclusion
Photosynthetic
cells
contain
chlorophyll
and
other
light
sensitive
pigments
that
capture
solar
energy
In
the
presence
of
carbon
dioxide
such
cells
are
able
to
convert
this
solar
energy
into
energy
rich
organic
molecules
such
as
glucose
These
cells
not
only
drive
the
global
carbon
cycle
but
they
also
produce
much
of
the
oxygen
present
in
atmosphere
of
the
Earth
Essentially
nonphotosynthetic
cells
use
the
products
of
photosynthesis
to
do
the
opposite
of
photosynthesis
break
down
glucose
and
release
carbon
dioxide

Seasonal

Choosing
a
light
box
Light
therapy
boxes
can
offer
an
effective
treatment
for
seasonal
affective
disorder
Features
such
as
light
intensity
safety
cost
and
style
are
important
considerations
By
Mayo
Clinic
Staff
Seasonal
affective
disorder
SAD
is
a
type
of
depression
that
typically
occurs
each
year
during
fall
and
winter
Use
of
a
light
box
can
offer
relief
But
for
some
people
light
therapy
may
be
more
effective
when
combined
with
another
SAD
treatment
such
as
an
antidepressant
or
psychotherapy
also
called
talk
therapy
Light
boxes
are
designed
to
deliver
a
therapeutic
dose
of
bright
light
to
treat
symptoms
of
SAD
There
are
many
different
types
of
light
boxes
All
light
boxes
for
SAD
treatment
are
designed
do
the
same
thing
but
one
may
work
better
for
you
than
another
Talk
with
your
health
care
provider
first
It
s
best
to
talk
with
your
health
care
provider
about
choosing
and
using
a
light
box
If
you
re
experiencing
both
SAD
and
bipolar
disorder
the
advisability
and
timing
of
using
a
light
box
should
be
carefully
reviewed
with
your
health
care
provider
Increasing
exposure
too
fast
or
using
the
light
box
for
too
long
each
time
may
induce
manic
symptoms
if
you
have
bipolar
disorder
If
you
have
past
or
current
eye
problems
such
as
glaucoma
cataracts
or
eye
damage
from
diabetes
get
advice
from
your
eye
specialist
before
starting
light
therapy
Understanding
a
light
box
A
light
therapy
box
mimics
outdoor
light
It
s
thought
that
this
type
of
light
may
cause
a
chemical
change
in
the
brain
that
lifts
your
mood
and
eases
other
symptoms
of
SAD
such
as
being
tired
most
of
the
time
and
sleeping
too
much
Generally
the
light
box
should
Provide
an
exposure
to
lux
of
light
Produce
as
little
UV
light
as
possible
Typical
recommendations
include
using
the
light
box
Within
the
first
hour
of
waking
up
in
the
morning
For
about
to
minutes
About
to
inches
to
centimeters
from
your
face
but
follow
the
manufacturer
s
instructions
about
distance
With
eyes
open
but
not
looking
directly
at
the
light
Light
boxes
aren
t
regulated
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
FDA
for
SAD
treatment
so
it
s
important
to
understand
your
options
You
can
buy
a
light
box
without
a
prescription
but
it
s
best
to
use
it
under
the
guidance
of
a
health
care
provider
and
follow
the
manufacturer
s
guidelines
Your
health
care
provider
may
recommend
a
specific
light
box
Most
health
insurance
plans
don
t
cover
the
cost
What
to
consider
Here
are
some
questions
to
think
about
when
buying
a
light
box
for
seasonal
affective
disorder
Is
it
made
specifically
to
treat
SAD
If
not
it
may
not
help
your
depression
Some
light
therapy
lamps
are
designed
for
skin
disorders
not
for
SAD
Lamps
used
for
skin
disorders
mainly
produce
ultraviolet
UV
light
and
could
damage
your
eyes
if
used
incorrectly
How
bright
is
it
Light
boxes
produce
different
intensities
of
light
Brighter
boxes
will
require
less
time
to
use
each
day
compared
with
dimmer
boxes
to
achieve
the
same
effect
Usually
the
recommended
intensity
of
light
is
lux
How
much
UV
light
does
it
release
Light
boxes
for
SAD
should
be
designed
to
filter
out
most
or
all
UV
light
Contact
the
manufacturer
for
safety
information
if
you
have
questions
Can
it
cause
eye
damage
Some
light
boxes
include
features
designed
to
protect
the
eyes
Make
sure
the
light
box
filters
out
most
or
all
UV
light
to
avoid
damaging
your
eyes
Ask
your
eye
specialist
for
advice
on
choosing
a
light
box
if
you
have
eye
problems
such
as
glaucoma
cataracts
or
eye
damage
from
diabetes
Is
it
the
style
you
need
Light
boxes
come
in
different
shapes
and
sizes
with
varied
features
Some
look
like
upright
lamps
while
others
are
small
and
rectangular
Smaller
light
boxes
are
more
portable
and
easier
to
pack
if
you
re
traveling
during
fall
and
winter
The
effectiveness
of
a
light
box
depends
on
daily
use
so
buy
one
that
s
convenient
for
you
Can
you
put
it
in
the
right
location
Think
about
where
you
ll
want
to
place
your
light
box
and
what
you
might
do
during
its
use
such
as
reading
doing
a
craft
or
watching
TV
Check
the
manufacturer
s
instructions
so
you
receive
the
right
amount
of
light
at
the
proper
distance
Talk
to
your
health
care
provider
about
light
box
options
and
recommendations
so
you
get
one
that
s
best
suited
to
your
needs

Takeaways
Blue
light
is
a
wavelength
of
light
often
emitted
by
electronic
devices
and
artificial
lights
During
the
day
blue
light
influences
your
circadian
rhythm
affecting
alertness
and
heart
rate
Limiting
blue
light
at
night
can
help
mitigate
its
effects
on
sleep
The
screens
of
electronic
devices
such
as
smartphones
computers
tablets
and
televisions
can
emit
blue
light
that
disrupts
our
natural
sleep
cycles
Research
shows
that
a
majority
of
Americans
use
electronic
devices
within
an
hour
of
going
to
bed
which
can
lead
to
unsatisfactory
sleep
Decreasing
exposure
to
light
in
the
evening
and
blue
light
in
particular
is
an
important
way
to
help
your
body
naturally
prepare
for

rest

What
Is
Blue
Light
Light
is
composed
of
electromagnetic
radiation
which
is
an
invisible
form
of
energy
Our
eyes
interpret
colors
of
light
based
on
the
amount
of
energy
they
contain
White
light
including
some
light
emitted
by
the
sun
is
the
combination
of
all
the
colors
of
the
visible
light
spectrum
Blue
light
is
a
portion
of
the
visible
light
spectrum
that
can
influence
alertness
hormone
production
and
sleep
cycles
This
wavelength
of
light
is
emitted
by
LED
and
fluorescent
lights
as
well
as
many
electronic
devices

Mitigating
the
Effects
of
Blue
Light
The
most
effective
way
to
reduce
exposure
to
blue
light
in
the
evening
is
to
simply
turn
off
the
sources
This
means
dimming
or
reducing
LED
and
fluorescent
lighting
in
your
home
and
turning
off
electronic
devices
after
it
gets
dark
outside
Specialty
glasses
may
also
be
helpful
in
reducing
exposure
to
blue
light
While
they
may
not

blue

It
may
not
always
be
feasible
to
turn
off
sources
of
blue
light
after
dark
but
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
to
reduce
blue
light
exposure
that
may
be
interfering
with
your
sleep
Make
it
a
routine
Set
an
alarm
that
reminds
you
to
turn
off
electronics
two
to
three
hours
before
bedtime
Use
a
different
lamp
If
you
enjoy
reading
in
bed
try
a
lamp
that
emits
red
or
orange
light
rather
than
blue
Learn
to
dim
Dim
the
brightness
of
your
electronic
screens
or
use
the
night
mode
feature
found
on
some
devices
Try
an
app
If
you
need
to
use
devices
before
bed
try
out
one
of
several
smartphone
and
computer
applications
that
can
help
reduce
blue
light
emission
Improve
your
sleeping
environment
If
there
are
light
sources
in
your

that
you
are
unable
to

On
January
King
Haakon
VII
of
Norway
went
to
the
University
of
Oslo
to
hear
a
lecture
by
the
physicist
Kristian
Birkeland
who
believed
that
he
had
unlocked
the
secrets
of
the
aurora
borealis
also
known
as
the
northern
lights
Birkeland
planned
to
demonstrate
his
theory
with
the
aid
of
a
specially
constructed
device
a
brass
plated
magnetic
sphere
called
a
terrella
suspended
inside
a
vacuum
chamber
with
glass
sides
and
an
electrode
on
one
end
When
the
electrode
was
heated
it
would
shoot
cathode
rays
across
the
chamber
toward
the
sphere
If
all
went
well
the
rays
would
interact
with
the
sphere
s
magnetic
field
producing
eerie
flashes
of
light
that
replicated
in
miniature
the
aurora
borealis
As
Birkeland
s
biographer
Lucy
Jago
tells
it
the
lecture
was
a
triumph
The
contraption
didn
t
electrocute
anybody
or
implode
in
splinters
of
flying
glass
as
earlier
models
had
tended
to
do
and
obligingly
produced
a
diminutive
version
of
the
aurora
s
luminous
flux
dazzling
the
King
Word
spread
and
a
Nobel
Prize
was
widely
predicted
yet
England
s
Royal
Society
at
the
time
the
arbiter
of
scientific
fact
was
unimpressed
and
treated
Birkeland
as
an
amateur
with
a
hopelessly
inadequate
grasp
of
theoretical
physics
He
died
in
and
it
wasn
t
until
the
nineteen
sixties
that
satellite
data
proved
his
hypothesis
to
be
correct
The
lights
are
caused
by
high
velocity
solar
particles
the
solar
wind
as
it
came
to
be
called
interacting
with
the
Earth
s
magnetic
field
and
atmosphere
Birkeland
remains
underappreciated
but
his
imprint
can
be
felt
in
the
mixture
of
engineering
wizardry
and
primal
enchantment
that
is
fuelling
a
touristic
boom
in
countries
where
the
northern
lights
appear
As
I
discovered
on
a
trip
to
the
Arctic
in
February
the
glow
of
an
aurora
is
sometimes
difficult
to
perceive
with
the
naked
eye
and
travellers
often
must
engage
in
a
form
of
technologically
enhanced
rapture
The
best
chances
of
seeing
the
lights
are
in
the
elliptical
area
known
as
the
Auroral
Oval
which
is
centered
on
geomagnetic
north
The
Earth
s
magnetic
field
becomes
almost
perpendicular
to
its
surface
here
drawing
the
solar
particles
into
the
atmosphere
Much
of
Siberia
falls
within
the
zone
but
I
decided
to
visit
northern
Scandinavia
where
the
art
of
maintaining
extreme
comfort
in
the
face
of
extreme
cold
seemed
likely
to
be
more
advanced
Among
the
region
s
more
tempting
accommodations
are
the
glass
igloo
hotels
of
Finland
where
you
can
simply
lie
back
and
watch
the
show
in
bed

I
stayed
at
a
newish
igloo
hotel
the
Aurora
Village
near
the
town
of
Ivalo
in
the
far
north
of
the
country
It
sounded
more
appealing
than
the
much
Instagrammed
original
in
Kakslauttanen
having
fewer
igloos
and
no
Santa
s
Home
on
the
compound
I
arrived
late
exhausted
from
the
knock
on
effects
of
a
cancelled
flight
The
hotel
s
twenty
eight
Aurora
Cabins
set
around
a
large
reindeer
paddock
looked
like
quaint
log
huts
from
the
front
with
twenty
inches
of
moonlit
snow
on
the
eaves
Inside
the
rustic
gave
way
to
the
futuristic
A
glass
panelled
dome
loomed
over
the
north
facing
end
of
a
single
room
with
luxe
bedding
and
a
complimentary
drinks
tray
arranged
below
like
the
furnishings
of
a
tastefully
debauched
starship
Slipping
under
a
reindeer
fur
coverlet
I
found
myself
facing
the
first
conundrum
of
northern
lights
tourism
which
is
that
the
more
comfortable
your
viewing
situation
the
more
likely
you
are
to
be
insensate
when
the
lights
appear
I
was
eager
to
see
them
naturally
but
not
obsessed
I
had
a
whole
week
and
from
what
I
d
read
at
the
time
of
my
visit
there
were
good
odds
for
a
display
on
most
nights
With
this
comforting
thought
I
fell
asleep
You
can
be
woken
in
the
middle
of
the
night
if
you
wish
and
there
are
apps
that
will
rouse
you
at
the
right
moment
but
you
can
t
do
anything
about
cloudy
skies
or
daylight
The
phenomenon
that
produces
the
lights
can
occur
at
any
hour
For
the
tourist
the
question
arises
what
do
you
do
when
there
s
no
prospect
of
seeing
the
lights
which
is
much
of
the
time
The
answer
is
activities
although
safari
is
the
perversely
tropical
term
of
choice
you
can
go
on
a
reindeer
safari
a
husky
safari
an
ice
fishing
safari
a
snowmobile
safari
a
king
crab
safari
I
talked
to
the
activities
manager
at
the
Aurora
Village
Abraham
Montes
over
breakfast
in
the
resort
s
dining
hall
a
conical
structure
made
of
spruce
planks
and
it
became
clear
that
his
job
had
as
much
to
do
with
managing
expectations
as
activities
The
first
thing
people
ask
is
What
time
does
the
aurora
begin
he
told
me
He
was
exaggerating
but
only
a
bit
in
recent
years
he
acknowledged
tourists
have
become
increasingly
fixated
on
the
goal
of
catching
a
brilliant
display
Montes
hedged
against
their
disappointment
by
recommending
at
least
one
activity
a
day
In
addition
to
the
safaris
you
could
visit
a
sauna
or
go
on
a
cultural
excursion
called
the
Authentic
S
mi
Experience
in
which
native
Laplanders
welcome
guests
into
a
l
vvu
a
tepee
like
shelter
and
sing
traditional
songs
around
a
fire
I
joined
an
ice
fishing
safari
that
Montes
was
leading
We
climbed
into
a
covered
sled
with
portholes
and
zipped
out
onto
a
frozen
river
nearby
A
cutting
wind
blew
across
the
ice
and
I
was
glad
of
the
day
that
I
d
spent
in
New
Jersey
malls
buying
advanced
thermal
gear
With
me
was
a
German
couple
who
seemed
serious
about
the
fishing
and
a
Malaysian
family
with
a
young
daughter
who
d
come
to
Finland
because
the
lights
were
on
their
bucket
list
a
term
that
has
gone
global
Montes
showed
us
how
to
drill
holes
with
an
auger
and
baited
our
hooks
with
plastic
worms
He
d
planned
to
use
real
ones
but
they
had
frozen
during
the
night
The
fishing
rods
seemed
absurdly
short
and
bendy
like
something
that
you
might
use
to
win
a
prize
at
an
amusement
park
We
squatted
at
our
holes
dipping
and
raising
as
instructed
The
flat
landscape
around
us
was
more
built
up
than
I
d
expected
this
far
north
but
pleasant
enough
under
the
fresh
snow
with
the
wide
sky
showing
different
pinks
and
yellows
every
time
you
looked
at
it
Now
and
then
dogsleds
carrying
tourists
hurtled
by
each
time
we
laboriously
took
off
our
mittens
and
glove
liners
and
rummaged
for
our
phones
in
order
to
take
photographs
I
asked
Montes
what
role
social
media
had
played
in
northern
lights
tourism
and
he
gave
an
exasperated
laugh
The
Ivalo
hotel
was
constantly
being
approached
by
YouTubers
and
Instagram
influencers
who
offered
publicity
in
return
for
free
accommodations
It
s
hard
to
calculate
the
benefits
but
they
post
pictures
and
it
s
good
for
us
to
have
people
know
there
are
glass
igloos
beyond
Kakslauttanen
so
sometimes
we
say
yes
he
said
We
just
had
two
of
them
staying
with
five
hundred
thousand
followers
each
They
wanted
free
rooms
free
everything
He
mentioned
a
BuzzFeed
article
on
the
Kakslauttanen
igloos
citing
it
as
a
pivotal
event
in
the
aurora
industry
It
was
published
on
the
eve
of
a
solar
maximum
a
high
point
in
the
eleven
year
cycle
of
solar
activity
and
many
people
who
visited
the
Arctic
soon
afterward
were
treated
to
glorious
displays
The
article
also
coincided
with
Instagram
s
drift
from
cats
and
food
to
landscapes
and
natural
phenomena
The
image
of
those
igloos
was
suddenly
everywhere
Montes
said
We
were
nearing
the
low
point
in
the
solar
cycle
now
he
noted
though
he
assured
me
that
the
lights
could
still
be
thrilling
adding
You
just
have
to
be
lucky
The
Germans
were
looking
a
little
frustrated
by
their
ice
hole
and
I
got
the
feeling
that
we
weren
t
presenting
much
of
a
threat
to
the
pike
and
grayling
allegedly
massing
below
us
Nobody
caught
anything
We
headed
back
to
the
hotel
where
I
ate
a
bowl
of
spaghetti
with
a
reindeer
Bolognese
sauce
I
returned
outside
for
a
happy
few
hours
of
cross
country
skiing
That
evening
the
forecast
apps
suggested
that
I
had
a
less
than
twenty
per
cent
chance
of
seeing
an
aurora
It
didn
t
seem
worth
mounting
a
vigil
and
once
again
I
fell
guiltily
expensively
asleep
Something
woke
me
at
three
Groggy
and
myopic
I
caught
a
promising
green
blur
overhead
and
grabbed
my
glasses
The
color
of
an
aurora
depends
on
which
atmospheric
gases
are
being
pelted
by
solar
particles
Oxygen
emits
a
greenish
hue
and
occasionally
red
nitrogen
emits
violet
and
blue
In
this
case
the
green
turned
out
to
be
emitted
by
a
light
on
the
thermostat
its
glow
was
reflected
in
the
glass
dome
Nevertheless
the
sky
had
cleared
and
the
stars
glittered
promisingly
above
the
snow
gloved
spruce
trees
I
stared
up
for
a
while
Gazing
at
the
sky
at
a
m
however
in
the
hope
of
being
granted
a
vision
of
dancing
emerald
lights
is
an
activity
that
quickly
starts
to
feel
absurd
even
delusional
and
I
soon
passed
out
again
In
the
morning
I
learned
that
I
hadn
t
missed
anything
Over
the
years
I
ve
sampled
some
extravagant
framings
of
natural
wonders
a
helicopter
ride
into
the
Grand
Canyon
orcas
seen
from
a
hydrofoil
in
Puget
Sound
I
have
some
puritanical
distrust
of
good
things
being
handed
to
one
on
a
plate
but
I
can
t
pretend
that
I
haven
t
enjoyed
these
adventures
In
those
cases
the
fun
was
partly
about
comfort
but
it
was
also
about
the
feeling
of
accelerated
gratification
My
igloo
was
extremely
comfortable
but
it
lacked
that
crucial
element
of
being
able
to
speed
things
along
You
need
just
as
much
patience
in
a
glass
igloo
as
you
do
in

I
went
a
bit
farther
north
to
the
vast
frozen
lake
of
Inari
where
the
lack
of
light
pollution
supposedly
raises
the
chances
of
seeing
the
lights
Here
as
everywhere
my
hotel
was
packed
tour
buses
and
S
U
V
s
lined
the
parking
lot
Guests
in
puffer
jackets
were
riding
fatbikes
on
the
ice
Inside
at
the
buffet
they
piled
plates
with
saut
ed
reindeer
and
lingonberries
The
Activities
Book
at
the
front
desk
offered
the
usual
excursions
along
with
a
Lappish
Dinner
featuring
a
real
S
mi
person
I
signed
up
for
Aurora
Camp
which
promised
warm
drinks
while
waiting
for
the
sky
to
show
its
magic
I
liked
the
confidence
of
the
description
it
made
the
magic
sound
more
like
a
scheduled
event
than
like
a
mere
hope
Fiat
lux
At
eight
o
clock
a
dozen
other
campers
and
I
were
issued
stiff
blue
and
black
snowsuits
that
turned
us
into
identical
Lego
people
A
snowmobile
towed
us
across
the
lake
in
a
train
of
open
sleds
Once
we
were
on
the
other
side
a
guide
lit
a
fire
draping
reindeer
hides
over
logs
for
us
to
sit
on
and
hung
a
kettle
to
boil
The
simplicity
of
the
arrangement
appealed
to
my
sense
of
how
these
things
ought
to
be
conducted
and
even
though
there
was
thick
cloud
cover
I
felt
optimistic
We
had
two
and
a
half
hours
to
kill
and
the
weather
as
we
reminded
one
another
at
regular
intervals
was
unpredictable
in
these
parts
Most
of
the
people
in
our
group
were
Chinese
on
vacation
for
the
Chinese
New
Year
But
I
also
heard
Italian
voices
and
the
genteel
tones
of
Home
Counties
English
Those
came
from
a
British
couple
recent
retirees
from
Surrey
who
were
checking
things
off
their
bucket
list
A
safari
in
Zambia
would
follow
the
northern
lights
They
d
been
in
Inari
for
four
nights
and
had
seen
a
faint
glow
one
evening
after
being
roused
by
the
hotel
s
Aurora
Alert
It
hadn
t
impressed
them
Definitely
not
worth
being
woken
up
for
they
said
They
talked
about
the
disparity
between
photographs
of
the
aurora
borealis
and
what
you
can
actually
see
making
some
technical
point
that
I
didn
t
take
in
at
the
time
and
grumbled
They
ought
to
tell
you
about
this
I
asked
them
if
they
regretted
coming
Not
at
all
they
said
They
had
enjoyed
the
activities
and
appreciated
the
differentness
of
the
place
the
Finnish
tundra
is
another
world
from
Surrey
It
s
like
in
Africa
where
you
know
you
might
not
see
anything
but
you
just
enjoy
the
whole
experience
they
said
Our
guide
young
but
practiced
in
the
art
of
distracting
cold
tourists
poured
hot
berry
juice
and
discoursed
on
Arctic
matters
He
told
us
the
average
number
of
hairs
on
a
square
centimetre
of
a
reindeer
s
back
seventeen
hundred
and
explained
the
logic
behind
the
Kp
index
a
tool
for
predicting
auroras
The
index
in
use
since
measures
disturbances
in
the
Earth
s
magnetic
field
with
stronger
disturbances
indicating
higher
chances
of
seeing
an
aurora
A
smudge
of
light
appeared
to
the
west
and
we
looked
at
our
guide
hopefully
but
he
shook
his
head
it
was
just
snowmobile
headlights
reflected
by
clouds
Someone
asked
him
what
it
felt
like
to
see
a
truly
powerful
display
and
he
replied
that
it
was
a
spiritual
experience
I
pressed
him
on
this
Well
it
s
about
community
he
said
One
person
s
wonder
communicates
itself
to
the
rest
of
the
group
and
you
get
this
flow
of
emotion
It
seemed
like
a
good
answer
It
certainly
accounted
for
a
vague
feeling
I
d
had
in
my
glass
igloo
which
was
that
even
if
I
did
see
the
lights
there
d
be
something
sad
and
incomplete
about
not
having
anyone
with
me
to
share
the
experience
I
d
been
with
an
old
friend
when
I
helicoptered
into
the
Grand
Canyon
My
son
was
with
me
for
the
orcas
in
Puget
Sound
The
sky
showed
no
sign
of
clearing
and
the
Kp
index
reading
had
plummeted
Meanwhile
the
temperature
had
fallen
to
minus
ten
degrees
Fahrenheit
which
turned
every
gust
of
wind
into
a
scouring
assault
People
were
pulling
up
balaclavas
and
stamping
their
feet
No
surprises
occurred
overhead
but
an
earthly
one
did
a
woman
suddenly
slipped
her
arm
through
mine
and
began
murmuring
in
my
ear
in
Italian
I
looked
at
her
and
she
gave
a
shriek
she
d
mistaken
me
in
my
snowsuit
for
her
husband
Peals
of
unnerving
laughter
broke
from
her
as
we
sledded
back
across
the
lake
The
incident
gave
concreteness
to
the
dim
sense
of
cosmic
disfavor
beginning
to
take
hold
in
me
The
nature
of
these
wonder
chasing
trips
is
that
your
success
rate
sooner
or
later
gets
entangled
with
your
feelings
about
what
you
deserve
I
had
four
more
nights
so
there
was
no
cause
for
serious
alarm
but
I
d
started
entertaining
irrational
thoughts
all
the
same
Was
I
unworthy
in
some
way
Could
I
be
harboring
attitudes
unconducive
to
the
granting
of
heavenly
visions
A
couple
of
incidents
the
next
day
deepened
this
mood
I
was
on
my
way
to
Troms
in
Norway
To
get
there
without
making
an
extended
southern
detour
to
Oslo
I
had
to
take
a
three
hour
taxi
ride
from
Inari
to
the
Norwegian
village
of
Lakselv
which
has
an
airport
As
we
drove
northwest
the
landscape
and
the
sky
merged
into
a
white
haze
with
only
the
dark
etched
undersides
of
branches
to
distinguish
one
realm
from
the
other
It
was
beautiful
in
an
unearthly
way
as
if
the
world
had
become
a
silver
nitrate
photograph
of
itself
Road
signs
grew
fewer
and
farther
between
with
S
mi
place
names
appearing
under
the
Finnish
The
road
was
covered
with
packed
snow
and
the
driver
was
going
fast
On
a
long
straight
desolate
stretch
we
came
over
a
rise
and
saw
five
reindeer
galloping
straight
toward
us
The
driver
cursed
in
English
Shit
I
braced
myself
felt
a
slam
and
saw
one
of
the
animals
thrown
into
the
air
It
had
antlers
and
as
the
previous
night
s
guide
had
informed
us
a
deer
that
still
had
them
in
late
winter
was
female
and
probably
pregnant
We
backed
up
and
found
it
lying
dead
in
the
snow
The
taxi
was
dented
but
drivable
and
after
reporting
the
accident
we
continued
on
our
way
both
of
us
badly
shaken

For
the

the

arises
what
do
you
do
when
there
s
no
prospect
of
seeing
the

which
is
much
of
the

We
arrived
at
the
airport
at
a
m
I
got
out
of
the
taxi
and
approached
the
automatic
door
but
it
didn
t
open
I
turned
to
call
back
my
driver
but
he
d
sped
off
into
the
frozen
wilderness
I
shouted
and
banged
on
the
airport
windows
but
nobody
was
inside
A
stuffed
reindeer
harnessed
to
a
sleigh
stared
at
me
through
the
plate
glass
of
the
empty
departure
lounge
Under
the
circumstances
it
was
impossible
not
to
read
judgment
in
its
blank
expression
Nordic
folklore
tends
to
view
the
northern
lights
as
a
not
entirely
benign
phenomenon
S
mi
mythology
in
particular
invests
them
with
highly
equivocal
powers
They
can
predict
the
weather
but
they
can
also
whisk
people
away
You
can
attract
them
by
whistling
but
you
do
so
at
your
peril
As
I
stood
on
the
airport
curb
wondering
what
to
do
it
struck
me
that
the
aurora
industry
was
a
kind
of
elaborate
whistling
for
the
lights
with
all
the
folly
and
hubris
that
this
entailed
It
sold
itself
as
a
romance
with
nature
at
its
most
magical
but
it
was
premised
on
a
comprehensive
battle
against
nature
Its
imagery
of
cozy
warmth
and
gliding
ease
had
been
concocted
in
defiance
of
a
lethally
dangerous
environment
where
you
were
entirely
dependent
on
protections
devised
by
other
humans
It
seemed
to
me
that
I
was
now
being
shown
what
happened
when
those
systems
malfunctioned
I
felt
scared
and
stupid
I
was
a
fool
about
to
freeze
to
death
in
pursuit
of
a
high
end
tourist
fad
Eventually
I
flagged
down
a
passing
car
whose
driver
promised
to
make
a
call
on
my
behalf
and
after
a
long
twenty
minutes
an
airport
worker
appeared
and
opened
the
doors
He
laughed
at
my
story
telling
me
that
I
d
arrived
far
too
early
for
my
afternoon
flight
Two
hours
later
just
before
takeoff
other
passengers
began
strolling
in
blas
locals
in
T
shirts
and
sneakers
Troms
is
a
compact
gleaming
city
set
dramatically
on
two
sides
of
a
sound
with
an
old
quarter
of
timber
buildings
a
thriving
fishing
industry
and
the
world
s
northernmost
university
I
ate
quantities
of
smoked
and
pickled
fish
and
visited
the
Polar
Museum
with
its
baleful
dioramas
of
trapped
foxes
and
hunters
clubbing
baby
seals
I
took
a
dogsled
safari
and
guided
Siberian
huskies
on
a
wobbly
but
exhilarating
ten
mile
dash
by
moonlight
across
stunning
upland
fells
In
every
one
of
Troms
s
hotel
lobbies
screens
glowed
with
images
of
the
lights
I
d
been
advised
to
try
looking
for
them
from
the
water
and
went
out
in
a
catamaran
The
city
sparkled
on
either
side
of
the
boat
as
the
skipper
and
I
cruised
down
the
sound
but
the
sky
was
solid
cloud
and
we
soon
gave
up
craning
our
necks
and
chatted
about
the
aurora
craze
instead
Everyone
seems
to
have
a
different
origin
story
The
skipper
attributed
the
boom
to
a
BBC
show
on
the
lights
featuring
Joanna
Lumley
As
he
put
it
There
was
before
Joanna
Lumley
and
there
was
after
Six
million
people
had
watched
the
Absolutely
Fabulous
star
diffuse
English
poshness
into
the
Arctic
mists
as
she
travelled
northward
through
Norway
The
sites
she
visited
were
soon
struggling
with
sudden
popularity
Google
the
Lofoten
Islands
an
archipelago
south
of
Troms
and
you
ll
learn
more
than
you
wanted
to
know
about
their
insufficient
number
of
public
toilets
Lumley
was
as
unlucky
as
I
was
until
she
came
to
Troms
where
her
guide
and
photographer
Kjetil
Skogli
finally
delivered
the
goods
In
the
show
s
orgasmic
climax
the
actress
lies
on
her
back
in
the
snow
as
the
sky
explodes
in
jets
of
green
I
met
with
Skogli
in
Troms
He
is
a
slight
unassuming
man
in
his
fifties
with
an
impish
way
of
deflecting
questions
about
his
post
Lumley
celebrity
clients
Brian
May
of
Queen
is
among
them
Skogli
grew
up
in
a
small
village
where
elders
spoke
the
S
mi
language
and
children
hid
from
the
lights
fearing
cosmic
abduction
An
evening
outing
with
a
photographer
friend
in
the
fall
of
coincided
with
a
series
of
unusually
intense
solar
storms
and
the
spectacle
awakened
Skogli
to
the
lights
glory
Mostly
you
just
see
green
he
told
me
But
you
saw
all
the
other
colors
that
night
The
snow
was
colored
red
He
was
also
awakened
to
the
lights
commercial
potential
The
northern
lights
wasn
t
a
product
at
that
time
he
recalled
But
they
re
one
of
the
purest
wonders
of
the
world
Moreover
the
lights
have
the
advantage
of
not
being
affected
by
global
warming
As
Skogli
put
it
We
can
t
do
anything
to
spoil
them

Photograph

for
The
New

He
set
up
a
photography
tour
company
that
pioneered
the
idea
of
the
Aurora
Chase
you
re
driven
around
for
six
or
more
hours
in
pursuit
of
favorable
conditions
for
viewing
the
lights
Every
fjord
and
fell
has
its
own
microclimate
and
so
in
theory
there
s
always
a
chance
of
finding
clear
skies
somewhere
After
the
Lumley
film
aired
Skogli
created
a
four
day
Lumley
Route
and
as
other
Scandinavians
got
into
the
aurora
chasing
business
he
began
working
with
local
landowners
to
set
up
base
stations
for
the
tourist
traffic
that
had
spread
across
the
region
It
s
not
good
to
see
fifty
or
sixty
coaches
parked
on
the
side
of
a
road
he
said
There
ve
been
some
very
close
accidents
We
discussed
why
the
aurora
often
looks
so
much
better
in
photographs
He
explained
that
a
camera
on
a
tripod
set
for
a
five
second
exposure
takes
in
far
more
light
than
the
human
eye
does
when
it
looks
at
something
and
consequently
it
produces
a
more
vivid
image
A
camera
can
turn
even
relatively
weak
displays
into
dramatic
pictures
and
these
images
can
then
be
subjected
to
digital
enhancements
Posted
online
the
pictures
are
automatically
sharpened
by
the
high
contrast
settings
of
most
social
media
platforms
and
further
boosted
by
the
backlit
screens
of
our
devices
Cumulatively
these
improvements
have
encouraged
unrealistic
expectations
It
s
a
shame
Skogli
said
You
have
a
responsibility
to
show
the
truth
He
has
tried
to
open
a
discussion
on
the
subject
within
the
tourism
industry
without
success
In
a
rare
departure
from
diplomatic
geniality
he
dismissed
most
Instagram
photos
of
the
lights
as
junk
digitally
colorized
files
to
produce
likes
Thinking
that
I
might
win
over
the
aurora
gods
by
trying
something
more
primitive
than
my
other
accommodations
I
d
signed
up
for
a
night
with
a
Finnish
company
that
takes
you
out
to
a
wilderness
camp
and
leaves
you
alone
until
morning
That
night
had
come
around
and
I
was
slightly
regretting
my
plan
I
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
but
various
scenarios
had
begun
filling
the
void
mostly
turning
on
the
idea
of
abandonment
and
slow
death
It
didn
t
help
that
the
tour
company
driver
had
a
penchant
for
morbid
tales
There
was
the
story
of
his
grandfather
who
had
died
of
a
heart
attack
while
herding
reindeer
and
had
been
left
in
a
tarp
on
the
roadside
where
his
son
recognized
the
boots
sticking
out
There
was
the
whale
that
starved
in
a
fjord
whose
corpse
had
to
be
towed
out
to
sea
and
exploded
Then
there
were
the
two
snowmobilers
who
d
recently
disappeared
after
going
off
piste
They
say
the
cold
gives
you
a
gentle
death
the
driver
observed
We
crossed
the
border
and
entered
the
village
of
Kilpisj
rvi
in
western
Finland
I
climbed
into
a
sled
and
my
amiable
and
capable
guide
Jussi
Rauhala
used
a
snowmobile
to
tow
me
to
the
camp
two
and
a
half
miles
across
the
frozen
surface
of
Lake
Kilpisj
rvi
At
the
midpoint
of
the
journey
he
stopped
and
got
off
the
snowmobile
to
see
how
I
was
doing
The
ice
is
fifteen
per
cent
thinner
than
usual
this
year
he
remarked
in
halting
but
studious
English
But
for
a
snowmobile
it
should
be
fine
We
rounded
a
promontory
with
scrubby
birches
doubled
over
by
snow
and
came
to
a
dark
hut
raised
up
on
sled
runners
on
the
ice
An
outhouse
stood
off
to
the
side
It
was
cozy
inside
the
hut
with
a
banged
together
quality
that
I
liked
though
spending
the
night
there
still
seemed
disconcerting
Jussi
turned
on
a
propane
heater
which
blasted
ferocious
heat
at
wooden
furnishings
a
few
feet
away
He
attached
several
spare
cannisters
of
fuel
to
the
heater
Just
in
case
they
run
out
he
explained
But
they
won
t
The
door
had
been
fitted
extra
tight
to
prevent
it
from
being
blown
open
by
the
wind
and
you
had
to
give
it
a
mighty
kick
to
get
out
The
possibility
of
being
unable
to
tug
the
door
back
open
was
enough
to
rule
out
any
thought
of
a
solitary
nocturnal
visit
to
the
outhouse
Jussi
possibly
noting
my
anxiousness
pointed
to
a
transparent
section
of
roof
above
the
bed
and
told
me
that
it
was
made
of
riot
shield
plastic
I
tried
to
look
reassured
We
walked
about
thirty
feet
to
the
shore
of
the
lake
and
set
up
a
fire
Jussi
assembled
a
camera
tripod
The
Kp
numbers
were
promising
and
a
pool
of
clear
sky
had
opened
among
the
clouds
with
the
Big
Dipper
brightly
visible
Jussi
programmed
his
camera
to
take
a
long
exposure
photograph
every
few
minutes
after
a
while
he
checked
the
monitor
and
saw
a
faint
green
glow
At
first
I
couldn
t
see
anything
in
the
sky
but
after
a
minute
what
had
looked
like
an
oblique
bar
of
cloud
began
turning
a
dim
grayish
green
It
was
tremendously
exciting
The
camera
then
began
registering
bands
of
red
although
they
weren
t
visible
to
the
naked
eye
they
signalled
that
there
was
a
strong
solar
wind
The
bar
in
the
sky
grew
brighter
but
a
terrestrial
wind
had
also
risen
driving
thick
clouds
straight
toward
it
A
tense
couple
of
minutes
followed
in
which
we
seemed
to
be
watching
an
elemental
standoff
between
darkness
and
light
For
a
few
moments
the
green
bar
was
surrounded
by
tinges
of
violet
the
effect
of
atmospheric
nitrogen
complementing
that
of
the
green
glowing
oxygen
But
the
clouds
kept
moving
implacably
forward
and
crushingly
the
bar
began
to
fade

I
could
now
say
truthfully
that
I
d
seen
the
northern
lights
and
I
was
happy
though
my
happiness
had
more
to
do
with
relief
mission
accomplished
than
with
joy
It
had
been
a
very
minor
spillage
of
the
green
grail
The
camera
kept
seeing
it
for
a
while
and
Jussi
was
able
to
take
some
photographs
of
me
posed
against
it
with
a
thumbs
up
and
a
grin
a
triumphant
bucket
list
warrior
It
s
hard
to
gauge
the
documentary
status
of
such
images
Do
they
memorialize
my
evening
or
the
camera
s
The
question
goes
to
the
heart
of
what
I
was
beginning
to
think
of
as
the
second
conundrum
of
northern
lights
tourism
its
seemingly
inextricable
incorporation
of
digital
technology
into
human
sensory
experience
It
was
time
for
Jussi
to
leave
He
gave
me
a
basket
of
food
and
a
Nokia
phone
for
emergencies
He
told
me
that
his
cousin
would
pick
me
up
at
eight
in
the
morning
if
he
wakes
up
He
paused
then
added
He
has
never
not
woken
up
But
just
in
case
he
does
not
wake
up
you
can
call
me
I
laughed
hoping
that
this
was
just
Finnish
humor
and
watched
him
disappear
into
the
darkness
Snow
was
falling
I
battened
down
the
hatches
and
got
into
bed
On
the
other
side
of
the
riot
shield
roof
the
clouds
grew
thicker
I
wondered
if
I
d
have
it
in
me
to
rise
to
the
occasion
if
I
did
see
a
major
display
When
an
industry
is
focussed
so
determinedly
on
the
commodity
of
wonderment
it
spurs
thoughts
of
resistance
at
least
it
does
in
me
Moreover
my
knowledge
that
the
lights
were
merely
an
effect
of
physical
forces
and
not
say
the
souls
of
stillborn
babies
or
reflections
of
the
armor
of
the
Valkyries
would
surely
limit
my
capacity
to
be
awestruck
I
slept
fitfully
trying
to
ignore
the
sounds
of
cracking
ice
that
I
kept
hearing
and
was
possibly
imagining
In
the
morning
congratulating
myself
on
not
having
used
the
emergency
phone
I
breakfasted
on
cloudberry
doughnuts
and
homemade
dried
reindeer
At
eight
o
clock
sharp
Jussi
s
cousin
picked
me
up
For
my
final
evening
in
Troms
I
d
booked
a
seat
on
an
Aurora
Chase
At
the
appointed
hour
I
joined
the
crowds
heading
down
to
the
waterfront
where
the
chase
vehicles
picked
up
passengers
I
heard
a
coach
driver
mutter
Not
the
best
weather
outlook
tonight
The
prospect
of
spending
the
next
six
hours
driving
around
with
little
hope
of
seeing
the
lights
was
deeply
unenticing
I
was
about
to
bail
on
the
adventure
when
a
burly
Norseman
barked
out
my
name
from
his
roster
I
meekly
boarded
his
sleek
black
van
We
headed
southeast
toward
Finland
The
Norseman
whose
name
was
Halfdan
kept
up
a
jovial
patter
as
we
sped
past
frozen
fjordscapes
I
d
already
learned
most
of
what
he
talked
about
aurora
factoids
camera
settings
advice
Kp
numbers
The
sense
of
d
j
vu
became
terrifyingly
complete
when
I
heard
the
driver
mutter
Shit
and
saw
a
moose
planted
like
a
thatched
cottage
on
the
road
ahead
of
us
At
the
last
moment
it
decamped
over
the
guardrail
and
our
lunatic
chase
continued
An
hour
into
Finland
we
pulled
off
the
main
road
and
parked
Using
his
phone
Halfdan
had
gathered
data
indicating
that
the
spot
was
auspicious
I
disembarked
with
fifteen
companions
into
the
freezing
night
Tripods
were
set
up
a
fire
was
built
I
chatted
with
the
driver
who
told
me
that
there
were
now
a
hundred
and
forty
chase
companies
operating
out
of
Troms
many
of
them
without
proper
permits
or
insurance
Every
hotel
was
at
capacity
He
mentioned
that
he
had
a
day
job
manufacturing
fishing
equipment
and
I
wondered
how
this
might
affect
his
night
driving
skills
A
second
bus
twice
the
size
of
ours
pulled
into
the
parking
area
I
had
become
highly
suspicious
of
all
the
apps
and
meteorological
charts
that
were
being
consulted
but
this
time
my
skepticism
was
misplaced
A
crack
appeared
in
the
clouds
directly
above
us
It
widened
showing
a
sprinkling
of
stars
and
then
the
entire
Big
Dipper
There
was
a
stirring
among
the
photographers
their
cameras
had
started
detecting
things
After
a
moment
an
oblique
greenish
bar
like
the
one
I
d
seen
the
night
before
became
visible
It
grew
brighter
and
denser
then
contracted
into
an
oval
of
emerald
light
People
chattered
excitedly
I
was
about
to
warn
them
not
to
get
too
carried
away
when
a
streak
of
brilliant
green
shot
out
of
the
oval
at
high
speed
and
zoomed
over
our
tipped
back
heads
corkscrewing
across
the
sky
I
almost
toppled
over
while
following
its
trajectory
The
green
light
formed
several
tentacles
which
twisted
and
writhed
together
and
looped
in
circles
Astonishment
was
proclaimed
in
a
half
dozen
languages
The
circles
dropped
needles
of
piercing
brightness
that
travelled
in
tandem
around
the
sky
as
if
tracing
the
undulations
of
a
celestial
shower
curtain
There
is
something
at
once
mind
blowing
and
unassimilable
about
the
phenomenon
The
aurora
borealis
is
in
Karl
Ove
Knausgaard
s
phrase
immensely
foreign
and
it
puts
you
into
a
kind
of
panic
in
which
you
want
to
simultaneously
observe
it
describe
it
rejoice
in
it
interpret
it
and
record
it
Nothing
you
ve
learned
or
read
about
the
subject
scientific
folkloric
touristic
seems
remotely
adequate
or
even
relevant
to
the
experience
You
develop
the
overwhelming
impression
that
some
cryptic
but
staggeringly
powerful
intelligence
is
staging
a
performance
expressly
for
you
even
as
you
remind
yourself
that
this
can
t
be
the
case
Surprisingly
intense
emotions
grip
you
I
remembered
something
that
Kjetil
Skogli
told
me
about
one
of
his
expeditions
an
English
guy
overcome
by
the
display
dropped
to
his
knees
and
proposed
to
his
girlfriend
Back
in
the
bus
the
photographers
among
the
group
compared
images
I
d
attempted
to
take
some
snapshots
on
my
phone
but
they
were
terrible
I
was
relieved
to
discover
that
Halfdan
had
taken
nice
pictures
of
each
of
us
including
one
of
me
with
the
stunned
look
of
a
nonbeliever
witnessing
a
miracle
He
promised
that
he
would
post
them
online
in
a
day
or
two
We
would
then
scatter
these
glowing
pixels
around
the
world
bringing
our
part
in
this
drama
of
pain
and
pleasure
of
eye
and
camera
of
reality
and
illusion
to
its
inevitable
close

LED
is
a
highly
energy
efficient
lighting
technology
and
has
the
potential
to
fundamentally
change
the
future
of
lighting
in
the
United

Residential
LEDs
especially
ENERGY
STAR
rated
products
use
at
least
less
energy
and

Widespread
use
of
LED
lighting
has
a
large
potential
impact
on
energy
savings
in
the
United
States
By
the
majority
of
lighting
installations
are
anticipated
to
use
LED
technology
and
energy

from

How
LEDs
are
Different
LED
lighting
is
very
different
from
other
lighting
types
such
as
incandescent
and
CFL
Key
differences
include
Light
Source
LEDs
are
the
size
of
a
fleck
of
pepper
and
can
emit
light
in
a
range
of
colors
A
mix
of
red
green
and
blue
LEDs
is
sometimes
used
to
make
white
light
Direction
LEDs
emit
light
in
a
specific
direction
reducing
the
need
for
reflectors
and
diffusers
that
can
trap
light
This
feature
makes
LEDs
more
efficient
for
many
uses
such
as
recessed
downlights
and
task
lighting
With
other
types
of
lighting
the
light
must
be
reflected
to
the
desired
direction
and
more
than
half
of
the
light
may
never
leave

LiFi
s
Inherent
Security
Edge
The
modus
operandi
of
LiFi
using
light
for
data
transfer
furnishes
it
with
intrinsic
security
advantages
A
standout
feature
is
the
confinement
of
light
bound
data
within
its
immediate
environment
courtesy
of
light
s
inability
to
traverse
walls
This
characteristic
ensures
that
data
interception
by
unauthorized
entities
outside
the
designated
space
becomes
a
near
impossibility
adding
a
robust
layer
of
security
to
wireless
communication
The
Promise
of
LiFi
When
compared
with
traditional
radio
wave
driven
technologies
LiFi
s
distinctiveness
is
hard
to
ignore
It
heralds
a
future
of
wireless
communication
marked
by
astounding
transmission
speeds
heightened
security
and
the
potential
to
radically
transform
our
digital
interactions
As
the
world
gravitates
towards
more
interconnected
devices
and
fluid
communication
LiFi
emerges
as
the
vanguard
technology
poised
to
redefine
our
digital
horizons
Understanding
LiFi
s
Technical
Foundations
LiFi
s
underpinning
is
both
innovative
and
straightforward
The
technology
relies
on
a
modulated
light
frequency
emitted
by
LED
light
sources
When
data
needs
to
be
transmitted
the
LED
s
brightness
oscillates
at
ultra
high
speeds
too
rapid
for
the
human
eye
to
perceive
These
oscillations
or
flickers
represent
binary
codes
of
s
and
s
essentially
the
language
of
computers
On
the
receiving
end
a
photosensitive
detector
captures
these
light
signals
The
detector
then
demodulates
the
light
fluctuations
back
into
electronic
data
Given
the
sheer
speed
of
these
oscillations
vast
amounts
of
data
can
be
transferred
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
Accompanying
an
explainer

this
should

intricate
dance
of
light
translates

What
does
LiFi
mean
for
everyone
LiFi
technology
is
poised
to
revolutionize
wireless
communication
providing
faster
and
more
secure
data
transfer
than
traditional
WiFi
Although
it
functions
similarly
to
WiFi
using
light
instead
of
radio
waves
to
transmit
data
LiFi
boasts
vastly
greater
bandwidth
capacity
making
it
ideal
for
use
in
densely
populated
urban
areas
In
fact
street
lamps
could
soon
be
used
to
provide
data
to
everything
from
pedestrians
to
vehicles
improving
the
functionality
of
city
infrastructure
While
currently
mainly
used
in
industrial
settings
LiFi
is
predicted
to
make
its
way
into
smart
homes
and
become
an
integral
part
of
future
building
automation
With
its
speed
and
security
advantages
LiFi
is
set
to
be
a
game
changer
in
the
world
of
wireless
communication
Why
is
LiFi
important
Consumption
of
wireless
data
increases
by
every
year
That
means
that
the
radio
frequency
space
is
slowly
becoming
saturated
which
can
lead
to
a
phenomenon
called
a
spectrum
crunch
Spectrum
crunch
refers
to
the
potential
lack
of
sufficient
wireless
frequency
spectrum
needed
to
support
a
growing
number
of
consumer
devices
along
with
various
government
and
private
sector
uses
of
radio
frequencies
within
a
broad
spectrum
allocated
for
different
types
of
wireless
communications
This
poses
challenges
with
wireless
networks
because
it
would
negatively
affect
the
speed
of
our
internet
usage
Eventually

to
launch
the
world
s
first
industrialized
LiFi
solution
which
has
been
deployed
in
multiple
locations
including
Microsoft
s
Paris
headquarters
The
LiFi
XC
system
released
in
is
a
certified
plug
and
play
system
that
works
with
USB
devices
and
can
be
integrated
into
laptops
tablets
and
smart
appliances
In
June
pureLiFi
offered
LiFi
starter
kits
to
academic
researchers
and
launched
a
channel
program
for
IT
resellers
to
add
LiFi
to
their
portfolio
LiFi
technology
provides
numerous
benefits
including
faster
internet
speed

sustainability
LiFi
technology
is
not
only
fast
but
it
is
also
environmentally
sustainable
One
of
the
main
advantages
of
LiFi
technology
is
that
it
eliminates
the
need
for
electronic
devices
such
as
routers
modems
signal
repeaters
wave
amplifiers
and
antennas
which
consume
energy
Since
LiFi
is
connected
to
LED
bulbs
it
does
not
require
additional
power
consumption
thus
reducing
costs
in
homes
and
workplaces
Furthermore
LiFi
technology
has
the
potential
to
use
solar
energy
to
transmit
data
making
it
possible
for
people
without
internet
access
or
with
limited
electricity
resources
to
connect
wirelessly
to
the
web
With
LiFi
there
is
a
great
opportunity
to
bring
internet
access
to
remote
and
underdeveloped
regions
which
can
help
bridge
the
digital
divide
As
more
and
more
companies
are
working
on
LiFi
products
and
many
LiFi
products
and
solutions
have
been
created
since
the

Lasers
are
amazing
light
beams
powerful
enough
to
zoom
miles
into
the
sky
or
cut
through
lumps
of
metal
Although
they
seem
pretty
recent
inventions
they
ve
actually
been
with
us
over
half
a
century
the
theory
was
figured
out
in
the
first
practical
laser
was
built
in
At
that
time
lasers
were
thrilling
examples
of
cutting
edge
science
secret
agent
James
Bond
was
almost
chopped
in
half
by
a
laser
beam
in
the
film
Goldfinger
But
apart
from
Bond
villains
no
one
else
had
any
idea
what
to
do
with
lasers
famously
they
were
described
as
a
solution
looking
for
a
problem
Today
we
all
have
lasers
in
our
homes
in
CD
and
DVD
players
in
our
offices
in
laser
printers
and
in
the
stores
where
we
shop
in
barcode
scanners
Our
clothes
are
cut
with
lasers
we
fix
our
eyesight
with
them
and
we
send
and
receive
emails
over
the
Internet
with
signals
that
lasers
fire
down
fiber
optic
cables
Whether
we
realize
it
or
not
all
of
us
use
lasers
all
day
long
but
how
many
of
us
really
understand
what
they
are
or
how
they
work
The
basic
idea
of
a
laser
is
simple
It
s
a
tube
that
concentrates
light
over
and
over
again
until
it
emerges
in
a
really
powerful
beam
But
how
does
this
happen
exactly
What
s
going
on
inside
a
laser
Let
s
take
a
closer
look

Lasers

more
than
just
powerful

The
difference
between
ordinary
light
and
laser
light
is
like
the
difference
between
ripples
in
your
bathtub
and
huge
waves
on
the
sea
You
ve
probably
noticed
that
if
you
move
your
hands
back
and
forth
in
the
bathtub
you
can
make
quite
strong
waves
If
you
keep
moving
your
hands
in
step
with
the
waves
you
make
the
waves
get
bigger
and
bigger
Imagine
doing
this
a
few
million
times
in
the
open
ocean
Before
long
you
d
have
mountainous
waves
towering
over
your
head
A
laser
does
something
similar
with
light
waves
It
starts
off
with
weak
light
and
keeps
adding
more
and
more
energy
so
the
light
waves
become
ever
more
concentrated

Laser
beams
follow
precise
paths
between
mirrors
in
a
laboratory
experiment
If
you
ve
even
seen
a
laser
in
a
science
lab
you
ll
have
noticed
two
very
important
differences
straightaway
Where
a
flashlight
produces
white
light
a
mixture
of
all
different
colors
made
by
light
waves
of
all
different
frequencies
a
laser
makes
what
s
called
monochromatic
light
of
a
single
very
precise
frequency
and
color
often
bright
red
or
green
or
an
invisible
color
such
as
infrared
or
ultraviolet
Where
a
flashlight
beam
spreads
out
through
a
lens
into
a
short
and
fairly
fuzzy
cone
a
laser
shoots
a
much
tighter
narrower
beam
over
a
much
longer
distance
we
say
it
s
highly
collimated
There
s
a
third
important
difference
you
won
t
have
noticed
Where
the
light
waves
in
a
flashlight
beam
are
all
jumbled
up
with
the
crests
of
some
beams
mixed
with
the
troughs
of
others
the
waves
in
laser
light
are
exactly
in
step
the
crest
of
every
wave
is
lined
up
with
the
crest
of
every
other
wave
We
say
laser
light
is
coherent
Think
of
a
flashlight
beam
as
a
crowd
of
commuters
pushing
and
shoving
jostling
their
way
down
the
platform
of
a
railroad
station
by
comparison
a
laser
beam
is
like
a
parade
of
soldiers
all
marching
precisely
in
step
These
three
things
make
lasers
precise
powerful
and
amazingly
useful
beams
of
energy
How
lasers
work
Before
you
can
understand
how
a
laser
works
you
need
to
know
how
an
atom
can
give
off
light
If
you
re
not
sure
how
this
happens
take
a
look
at
the
box
how
atoms
make
light
in
our
introductory
article
about
light
A
laser
is
effectively
a
machine
that
makes
billions
of
atoms
pump
out
trillions
of
photons
light
particles
all
at
once
so
they
line
up
to
form
a
really
concentrated
light
beam
What
do
you
need
to
make
a
laser
We
need
two
basic
parts
A
load
of
atoms
a
solid
liquid
or
gas
with
electrons
in
them
that
we
can
stimulate
This
is
known
as
the
medium
or
sometimes
the
amplifying
or
gain
medium
because
gain
is
another
word
for
amplification
Something
to
stimulate
the
atoms
with
such
as
a
flash
tube
like
the
xenon
flash
lamp
in
a
camera
or
another
laser
A
typical
red
laser
would
contain
a
long
crystal
made
of
ruby
the
medium
shown
in
the
artwork
below
as
a
red
bar
with
a
flash
tube
yellow
zig
zag
lines
wrapped
around
it
The
flash
tube
looks
a
bit
like
a
fluorescent
strip
light
only
it
s
coiled
around
the
ruby
crystal
and
it
flashes
every
so
often
like
a
camera
s
flash
lamp
How
do
the
flash
tube
and
the
crystal
make
a
laser
beam
How
a
laser
works
A
high
voltage
electric
supply
makes
the
tube
flash
on
and
off
Every
time
the
tube
flashes
it
pumps
energy
into
the
ruby
crystal
The
flashes
it
makes
inject
energy
into
the
crystal
in
the
form
of
photons
Atoms
in
the
ruby
crystal
large
green
blobs
soak
up
this
energy
in
a
process
called
absorption
Atoms
absorb
energy
when
their
electrons
jump
to
a
higher
energy
level
After
a
few
milliseconds
the
electrons
return
to
their
original
energy
level
ground
state
by
giving
off
a
photon
of
light
small
blue
blobs
This
is
called
spontaneous
emission
The
photons
that
atoms
give
off
zoom
up
and
down
inside
the
ruby
crystal
traveling
at
the
speed
of
light
Every
so
often
one
of
these
photons
stimulates
an
already
excited
atom
When
this
happens
the
excited
atom
gives
off
a
photon
and
we
get
our
original
photon
back
as
well
This
is
called
stimulated
emission
Now
one
photon
of
light
has
produced
two
so
the
light
has
been
amplified
increased
in
strength
In
other
words
light
amplification
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
light
has
been
caused
by
stimulated
emission
of
radiation
hence
the
name
laser
because
that
s
exactly
how
a
laser
works
A
mirror
at
one
end
of
the
laser
tube
keeps
the
photons
bouncing
back
and
forth
inside
the
crystal
A
partial
mirror
at
the
other
end
of
the
tube
bounces
some
photons
back
into
the
crystal
but
lets
some
escape
The
escaping
photons
form
a
very
concentrated
beam
of
powerful
laser
light

How
do
lasers
make
light
If
that
s
as
much
detail
as
you
want
to
know
about
lasers
you
can
stop
reading
now
or
skip
further
down
the
page
to
types
of
lasers
This
section
goes
over
the
same
points
from
the
box
above
in
a
bit
more
detail
and
a
little
bit
more
theoretically
You
ll
often
read
in
books
that
laser
stands
for
Light
Amplification
by
Stimulated
Emission
of
Radiation
That
s
a
complex
and
confusing
mouthful
but
if
you
pull
it
apart
slowly
it
s
actually
a
very
clear
explanation
of
how
lasers
make
their
super
powerful
beams
of
light
Spontaneous
emission
Let
s
start
with
the
R
of
laser
radiation
The
radiation
lasers
make
has
nothing
to
do
with
dangerous
radioactivity
the
stuff
that
makes
Geiger
counters
click
which
atoms
spew
out
when
they
smash
together
or
fall
apart
Lasers
make
electromagnetic
radiation
just
like
ordinary
light
radio
waves
X
rays
and
infrared
Although
it
s
still
produced
by
atoms
they
make
emit
it
in
a
totally
different
way
when
electrons
jump
up
and
down
inside
them
We
can
think
of
electrons
in
atoms
sitting
on
energy
levels
which
are
a
bit
like
rungs
on
a
ladder
Normally
electrons
sit
at
the
lowest
possible
level
which
is
called
the
atom
s
ground
state
If
you
fire
in
just
the
right
amount
of
energy
you
can
shift
an
electron
up
a
level
onto
the
next
rung
of
the
ladder
That
s
called
absorption
and
in
its
new
state
we
say
the
atom
s
excited
but
it
s
also
unstable
It
very
quickly
returns
to
the
ground
state
by
giving
off
the
energy
it
absorbed
as
a
photon
a
particle
of
light
We
call
this
process
spontaneous
emission
of
radiation
the
atom
is
giving
off
light
emitting
radiation
all
by
itself
spontaneously
Flame
wick
and
melted
wax
on

Photo
Spontaneous
emission
by
candlelight
From
candles
to
light
bulbs
and
fireflies
to
flashlights
all
conventional
forms
of
light
work
through
the
process
of
spontaneous
emission
In
a
candle
combustion
the
chemical
reaction
between
oxygen
and
fuel
in
this
case
wax
excites
atoms
and
makes
them
unstable
They
give
off
light
when
they
return
to
their
original
ground
states
Every
photon
produced
by
spontaneous
emission
inside
this
candle
flame
is
different
from
every
other
photon
which
is
why
there
s
a
mixture
of
different
wavelengths
and
colors
making
white
light
The
photons
emerge
in
random
directions
with
waves
that
are
out
of
step
with
one
another
out
of
phase
which
is
why
candlelight
is
much
weaker
than
laser
light
Stimulated
emission
Normally
a
typical
bunch
of
atoms
would
have
more
electrons
in
their
ground
states
than
their
excited
states
which
is
one
reason
why
atoms
don
t
spontaneously
give
off
light
But
what
if
we
excited
those
atoms
pumped
them
full
of
energy
so
their
electrons
were
in
excited
states
In
that
case
the
population
of
excited
electrons
would
be
bigger
than
the
population
in
their
ground
states
so
there
would
be
plenty
of
electrons
ready
and
willing
to
make
photons
of
light
We
call
this
situation
a
population
inversion
because
the
usual
state
of
affairs
in
the
atoms
is
swapped
around
inverted
Now
suppose
also
that
we
could
maintain
our
atoms
in
this
state
for
a
little
while
so
they
didn
t
automatically
jump
back
down
to
their
ground
state
a
temporarily
excited
condition
known
as
a
meta
stable
state
Then
we
d
find
something
really
interesting
If
we
fired
a
photon
with
just
the
right
energy
through
our
bunch
of
atoms
we
d
cause
one
of
the
excited
electrons
to
jump
back
down
to
its
ground
state
giving
off
both
the
photon
we
fired
in
and
the
photon
produced
by
the
electron
s
change
of
state
Because
we
re
stimulating
atoms
to
get
radiation
out
of
them
this
process
is
called
stimulated
emission
We
get
two
photons
out
after
putting
one
photon
in
effectively
doubling
our
light
and
amplifying
it
increasing
it
These
two
photons
can
stimulate
other
atoms
to
give
off
more
photons
so
pretty
soon
we
get
a
cascade
of
photons
a
chain
reaction
throwing
out
a
brilliant
beam
of
pure
coherent
laser
light
What
we
ve
done
here
is
amplify
light
using
stimulated
emission
of
radiation
and
that
s
how
a
laser
gets
its
name

got
here
is

making
more
light
by

emission
of
electromagnetic
radiation
LASER
What
makes
laser
light
so
different
If
that
s
how
lasers
make
light
why
do
they
make
a
single
color
and
a
coherent
beam
It
boils
down
to
the
idea
that
energy
can
only
exist
in
fixed
packets
each
of
which
is
called
a
quantum
It
s
a
bit
like
money
You
can
only
have
money
in
multiples
of
the
most
basic
unit
of
your
currency
which
might
be
a
cent
penny
rupee
or
whatever
You
can
t
have
a
tenth
of
a
cent
or
a
twentieth
of
a
rupee
but
you
can
have
cents
or
rupees
The
same
is
true
of
energy
and
it
s
particularly
noticeable
inside
atoms
Like
the
rungs
on
a
ladder
the
energy
levels
in
atoms
are
in
fixed
places
with
gaps
in
between
them
You
can
t
put
your
foot
anywhere
on
a
ladder
only
on
the
rungs
and
in
exactly
the
same
way
you
can
only
move
electrons
in
atoms
between
the
fixed
energy
levels
To
make
an
electron
jump
from
a
lower
to
a
higher
level
you
have
to
feed
in
a
precise
amount
quantum
of
energy
equal
to
the
difference
between
the
two
energy
levels
When
electrons
flip
back
down
from
their
excited
to
their
ground
state
they
give
out
the
same
precise
amount
of
energy
which

Types
of
lasers
Since
we
can
excite
many
different
kinds
of
atoms
in
many
different
ways
we
can
theoretically
make
many
different
kinds
of
lasers
In
practice
there
are
only
a
handful
of
common
kinds
of
which
the
five
best
known
are
solid
state
gas
liquid
dye
semiconductor
and
fiber
Solids
liquids
and
gases
are
the
three
main
states
of
matter
and
give
us
three
different
kinds
of
lasers
Solid
state
lasers
are
like
the
ones
I
illustrated
up
above
The
medium
is
something
like
a
ruby
rod
or
other
solid
crystalline
material
and
a
flashtube
wrapped
around
it
pumps
its
atoms
full
of
energy
To
work
effectively
the
solid
has
to
be
doped
a
process
that
replaces
some
of
the
solid
s
atoms
with
ions
of
impurities
giving
it
just
the
right
energy
levels
to
produce
laser
light
of
a
certain
precise
frequency

Solid
state
lasers
produce
high
powered
beams
typically
in
very
brief
pulses
Gas
lasers
by
contrast
produce
continuous
bright
beams
using
compounds
of
noble
gases
in
what
are
called
excimer
lasers
or
carbon
dioxide
CO
as
their
medium
pumped
by
electricity
CO
lasers
are
powerful
efficient
and
typically
used
in
industrial
cutting
and
welding
Liquid
dye
lasers
use
a
solution
of
organic
dye
molecules
as
the
medium
pumped
by
something
like
an
arc
lamp
a
flash
lamp
or
another
laser
Their
big
advantage
is
that
they
can
be
used
to
produce
a
broader
band
of
light
frequencies
than
solid
state
and
gas
lasers
and
they
can
even
be
tuned
to
produce
different
frequencies

While
solid
liquid
and
gas
lasers
tend
to
be
large
powerful
and
expensive
semiconductor
lasers
are
cheap
tiny
chip
like
devices
used
in
things
like
CD
players
laser
printers
and
barcode
scanners
They
work
like
a
cross
between
a
conventional
Light
emitting
diode
LED
and
a
traditional
laser
Like
an
LED
they
make
light
when
electrons
and
holes
effectively
missing
electrons
hop
about
and
join
together
like
a
laser
they
generate
coherent
monochromatic
light
That
s
why
they
re
sometimes
referred
to
as
laser
diodes
or
diode
lasers
You
can

more
about
them
in
our

Finally
fiber
lasers
work
their
magic
inside
optical
fibers
in
effect
a
doped
fiber
optic
cable
becomes
the
amplifying
medium
They
re

What
are
lasers
used
for
none
of
us
who
worked
on
the
first
lasers
imagined
how
many
uses
there
might
eventually
be
The
people
involved
motivated
mainly
by
curiosity
often
have
little
ideas
as
to
where
their
research
will
lead
Charles
Townes
How
the
Laser
Happened
When
Theodore
Ted
Maiman
developed
the
first
practical
laser
few
people
realized
how
important
these
machines
would
eventually
become
Goldfinger
the
James
Bond
movie
offered
a
tantalizing
glimpse
of
a
future
where
industrial
lasers
could
slice
like
magic
through
anything
in
their
path
even
secret
agents
Later
the
same
year
reporting
on
the
award
of
the
Nobel
Prize
in
Physics
to
the
laser
pioneer
Charles
Townes
The
New
York
Times
suggested
that
a
laser
beam
could
for
example
carry
all
the
radio
and
television
programs
in
the
world
plus
several
hundred
thousand
telephone
calls
simultaneously
It
is
used
extensively
for
range
finding
and
missile
tracking
Over
half
a
century
later
applications
like
this
precision
tools
digital
communication
and
defense
remain
among
the
most
important
uses
of
lasers

prints
a

the

printer
on
your

inside
it
is
used
to

of
the
page

want
to
print
onto
a
large

which
picks
up

and
transfers
it
onto

Tools
Cutting
tools
based
on
CO
lasers
are
widely
used
in
industry
they
re
precise
easy
to
automate
and
unlike
knives
never
need
sharpening
Where
pieces
of
cloth
were
once
cut
by
hand
to
make
things
like
denim
jeans
now
fabrics
are
chopped
by
robot
guided
lasers
They
re
faster
and
more
accurate
than
humans
and
can
cut
multiple
thicknesses
of
fabric
at
once
which
improves
efficiency
and
productivity
The
same
precision
is
equally
important
in
medicine
doctors
routinely
use
lasers
on
their
patients
bodies
for
everything
from
blasting
cancer
tumors
and
cauterizing
blood
vessels
to
correcting

The
military
has
long
been
one
of
the
biggest
users
of
this
technology
mainly
in
laser
guided
weapons
and
missiles
Despite
its
popularization
in
movies
and
on
TV
the
sci
fi
idea
of
laser
weapons
that
can
cut
kill
or
blind
an
enemy
remained
fanciful
until
the
mid
s
In
The
New
York
Times
went
so
far
as
to
quote
one
military
laser
expert
saying
It
s
just
silly
It
takes
more
energy
to
kill
a
single
man
with
a
laser
than
to
destroy
a
missile
Two
years
later
long
range
laser
weapons
officially
became
the
bedrock
of
US
President
Ronald
Reagan
s
controversial
Strategic
Defense
Initiative
SDI
better
known
as
the
Star
Wars
program
The
original
idea
was
to
use
space
based
X
ray
lasers
among
other
technologies
to
destroy
incoming
enemy
missiles
before
they
had
time
to
do
damage
though
the
plan
gradually
fizzled
out
following
the
collapse
of
the
Soviet
Union
and
the
end
of
the
Cold
War

Even
so

scientists
have
continued
to
transform
laser

missiles
from
science
fiction
into
reality
The
US
Navy
first
began
testing

Weapon
System
onboard
the
USS
Ponce
ship
in
the
Persian
Gulf
in
Using
solid

lasers
pumped

it
was
designed
to
damage
or
destroy
enemy
equipment
more
cheaply
and
precisely
than
conventional
missiles
The
tests
proved
successful
and
the
Navy
announced
contracts
to
build
more
LaWS

in
Meanwhile
the
development
of
space
lasers
continues
though
none
have
so

Who
invented
lasers
We
can
trace
the
birth
of
lasers
right
back
to
the
first
two
decades
of
the
th
century
That
s
when
Albert
Einstein
figured
out
the
quantum
theory
of
light
and
photons
in
and
the
mechanism
of
stimulated
emission
in
the
two
key
components
of
laser
science
But
it
was
another
four
decades
before
the
first
practical
laser
actually
appeared
Lasers
evolved
from
masers
which
are
similar
but
produce
microwaves
and
radio
waves
instead
of
visible
light
Masers
were
invented
in
the
s
by
Charles
Townes
and
Arthur
Schawlow
both
of
whom
went
on
to
win
the
Nobel
Prize
in
Physics
for
their
work
Townes
in
and
Schawlow
in
They
applied
to

their
invention
on

and
were
granted

But
did
they
invent
the

In
one
of
Townes
graduate
students
Gordon
Gould
sketched
in
his
lab
notebook
an
idea
for
how
a
visible
light
version
of
the
maser
could
work
coining
the
word
laser
that
we
ve
used
ever
since
Unfortunately
he
didn
t
patent
his
idea
at
the
time
and
had
to
devote
the
next
years
of
his
life
to
legal
battles
eventually
gaining
a
patent
for
part
of
the
laser
invention

was
actually
Theodore

who
has
never
really

was
rejected
by

and
despite
twice
being

Traffic
lights
traffic
signals
or
stoplights
also
known
as
robots
in
South
Africa
Zambia
and
Namibia
are
signalling
devices
positioned
at
road
intersections
pedestrian
crossings
and
other
locations
in
order
to
control
the
flow
of
traffic
Traffic
lights
usually
consist
of
three
signals
transmitting
meaningful
information
to
road
users
through
colours
and
symbols
including
arrows
and
bicycles
The
usual
traffic
light
colours
are
red
to
stop
traffic
amber
for
traffic
change
and
green
to
allow
traffic
to
proceed
These
are
arranged
vertically
or
horizontally
in
that
order
Although
this
is
internationally
standardised
variations
in
traffic
light
sequences
and
laws
exist
on
national
and
local
scales
Traffic
lights
were
first
introduced
in
December
on
Parliament
Square
in
London
to
reduce
the
need
for
police
officers
to
control
traffic
Since
then
electricity
and
computerised
control
have
advanced
traffic
light
technology
and
increased
intersection
capacity
The
system
is
also
used
for
other
purposes
including
the
control
of
pedestrian
movements
variable
lane
control
such
as
tidal
flow
systems
or
smart
motorways
and
railway

crossings

History
of
traffic
lights
In
December
the
first
traffic
signals
showing
a
red
or
green
light
at
night
were
installed
outside
the
Houses
of
Parliament
in
London
A
police
constable
raised
or
lowered
the
semaphore
arms
and
at
night
operated
a
lever
to
control
the
lights
which
drivers
and
pedestrians
saw
This
system
exploded
on
January
and
was
taken
down
This
early
traffic
signal
led
to
other
parts
of
the
world
implementing
similar
traffic
signal
systems
In
the
first
two
decades
of
the
th
century
semaphore
traffic
signals
like
the
one
in
London
were
in
use
all
over
the
United
States
These
traffic
signals
were
controlled
by
a
traffic
officer
who
changed
the
commands
on
the
signal
to
direct
traffic
In
the
first
electric
traffic
light
was
developed
by
Lester
Wire
a
policeman
in
Salt
Lake
City
Utah
In
August
it
was
installed
by
the
American
Traffic
Signal
Company
on
the
corner
of
East
th
Street
and
Euclid
Avenue
in
Cleveland
Ohio
In
the
first
four
way
three
colour
traffic
light
was
created
by
William
Potts
in
Detroit
Michigan
His
design
was
the
first
to
include
an
amber
caution
light
along
with
red
and
green
lights
Potts
was
Superintendent
of
Signals
for
the
Police
Department
of
Detroit
In
he
installed
automatic
four
way
three
colour
traffic
lights
in
towers
across
Detroit
By
traffic
towers
were
beginning
to
be
controlled
by
automatic
timers
more
widely
The
main
advantage
of
the
use
of
the
timer
was
that
it
saved
cities
money
by
replacing
traffic
officers
New
York
City
was
able
to
reassign
all
but
of
its
officers
working
on
the
traffic
squad
saving
the
city
In
Garrett
Morgan
patented
a
design
of
a
manually
operated
three
way
traffic
light
with
moving
arms
The
control
of
traffic
lights
changed
with
the
rise
of
computers
in
America
in
the
s
One
of
the
best
historical
examples
of
computerised
control
of
lights
was
in
Denver
Colorado
in
In
Toronto
Canada
was
the
first
to
use
more
advanced
computers
that
were
better
at
vehicle
detection
The
computers
maintained
control
over
signals
in
Toronto
through
telephone
lines

Meanings
of
signals
edit
The
Vienna
Convention
on
Road
Signs
and
Signals
Chapter
III
provides
international
standards
for
the
setup
of
traffic
signal
operations
Not
all
states
have
ratified
the
convention
A
three
colour
signal
head
should
have
three
non
flashing
lights
which
are
red
amber
and
green
arranged
either
horizontally
on
the
side
opposite
to
the
direction
of
traffic
clarification
needed
or
vertically
with
red
on
top
A
two
colour
signal
head
may
be
used
in
temporary
operation
and
consists
of
red
and
green
non
flashing
lights
In
both
cases
all
lights
should
be
circular
or
arrow
shaped
Permissible
signals
for
regulating
vehicle
traffic
other
than
public

In

in
these
locations
it
is
also
equipped
with
additional
alarms
and
voice
prompts
Amber
Traffic
may
proceed
but
with
caution
Green
arrows
are
added
to
signals
to
indicate
that
traffic
can
proceed
in
a
particular
direction
while
the
main
lights
for
that
approach
are
red
or
that
traffic
can
only
proceed
in
one
particular
direction
Alternatively
when
combined
with
another
green
signal
they
may
indicate
that
turning
traffic
has
priority
over
oncoming
traffic
known
as
a
filter
arrow
Flashing
amber
arrows
typically
indicate
that
road
users
must
give
way
to
other
drivers
and
pedestrians
before
making
a
movement
in
the
direction
of
the
arrow
These
are
used
because
they
are
safer
cause
less
delay
and
are
more
flexible
Flashing
amber
arrows
will
normally
be
located
below
the
solid
amber
Green
arrows
edit
Arrow
aspects
may
be
used
to
permit
certain
movements
or
convey
other
messages
to
road
users
A
green
arrow
may
display
to
require
drivers
to
turn
in
a
particular
direction
only
or
to
allow
drivers
to
continue
in
a
particular
direction
when
the
signal
is
red
Generally
a
green
phase
is
illuminated
at
the
beginning
of
the
green
phase
a
leading
turn
or
at
the
end
of
the
green
phase
a
lagging
turn
citation
needed
An
indicative
arrow
may
be
displayed
alongside
a
green
light
This
indicates
to
drivers
that
oncoming
traffic
is
stopped
such
that
they
do
not
need
to
give
way
to
that
traffic
when
turning
across
it
As
right
turning
traffic
left
side
drive
or
left
turning
traffic
right
side
drive
does
not
normally
have
priority
this
arrow
is
used
to
allow
turning
traffic
to
clear
before
the
next
phase
begins
Some
variations
of
this
setup
exist
One
version
is
a
horizontal
bar
with
five
lights
the
green
and
amber
arrows
are
located
between
the
standard
green
and
amber
lights
A
vertical
five
light
bar
holds
the
arrows
underneath
the
standard
green
light
In
this
arrangement
the
amber
arrow
is
sometimes
omitted
leaving
only
the
green
arrow
below
the
steady
green
light
or
possibly
an
LED
based
device
capable
of
showing
both
green
and
amber
arrows
within
a
single
lamp
housing
A
third
type
is
known
as
a
doghouse
or
cluster
head
a
vertical
column
with
the
two
normal
lights
is
on
the
right
side
of
the
signal
a
vertical
column
with
the
two
arrows
is
located
on
the
left
and
the
normal
red
signal
is
in
the
middle
above
the
two
columns
Cluster
signals
in
Australia
and
New
Zealand
use
six
signals
the
sixth
being
a
red
arrow
that
can
operate
separately
from
the
standard
red
light
citation
needed
In
a
fourth
type
sometimes
seen
at
intersections
in
Ontario
and
Quebec
Canada
there
is
no
dedicated
left
turn
lamp
per
se
Instead
the
normal
green
lamp
flashes
rapidly
indicating
permission
to
go
straight
as
well
as
make
a
left
turn
in
front
of
opposing
traffic
which
is
being
held
by
a
steady
red
lamp
This
advance
green
or
flashing
green
can
be
somewhat
startling
and
confusing
to
drivers
not
familiar
with
this
system
This
can
cause
confusion
amongst
visitors
to
British
Columbia
where
a
flashing
green
signal
denotes
a
pedestrian
controlled
crosswalk
For
this
reason
Ontario
is
phasing
out
the
use
of
flashing
green
signals
and
instead
replacing
them
with
arrows
Countdown
lights
edit
Popular
in
Vietnam
and
China
countdown
lights
are
additional
lights
installed
next
to
or
above
or
below
the
main
signal
lights
The
countdown
light
is
displayed
by
a
countdown
number
with
different
colours
usually
red
yellow
green
matching
the
colour
of
the
light
on
When
the
light
counts
to
or
the
main
light
colour
immediately
changes
Countdown
lights
may
have
zeros
in
the
tens
or
none
some
countdown
lights
may
flash
when
getting
ready
to
zero
Yellow
lights
can
have
countdown
lights
but
most
lights
do
not
Usually
the
countdown
light
has
digits
in
case
the
time
of
the
main
light
usually
the
red
light
rarely
the
green
light
is
longer
than
seconds
depending
on
the
type
of
light
the
following
possibilities
may
occur
Lights
have
not
counted
down
when
seconds
are
left
start

During
the
standby
time
the
light
may
be
displayed
as
or
not
displayed
Last

count
light
of
the
timeout
the
counter
light
is

Countdown
lights
are
also
used
for
both
vehicular
and

signals
in
the
Philippines
However
since
the
use
of
countdown
timers
have
been
phased
out
in
Metro
Manila
by
the
Metropolitan
Manila
Development
Authority
to
adopt
a
volume

system
As
a
result
instead

will
blink
five
times
before

Yellow
trap
edit
Without
an
all
red
phase
cross
turning
traffic
may
be
caught
in
a
yellow
trap
When
the
signal
turns
yellow
amber
a
turning
driver
may
assume
oncoming
traffic
will
stop
and
a
crash
may
result
For
this
reason
the
US
bans
sequences
that
may
cause
a
yellow
trap
This
can
also
happen
when
emergency
vehicles
or
railroads
preempt
normal
signal
operation
In
the
United
States
signs
reading
Oncoming

In

crossing
is
called
a

More
modern
iterations
are
puffin

In
the

The
Shibuya
Crossing
in
Tokyo
is
a
famous
example
of
a
pedestrian
scramble
with
diagonal
crossings

are
usually
incorporated
into
urban
signalised
junctions
in
one
of
four
ways
no

parallel
walk
walk
with
traffic
or
all

No
facilities
may
be
provided
if
pedestrian
demand
is
low
in
areas
where
pedestrians
are
not
permitted
or
if
there
is
a
subway
or
overpass
No
provision
of
formal
facilities
means
pedestrians
will
have
to
self
evaluate
when
it
is
safe
to
cross
which
can
be
intimidating
for
pedestrians
With
a
parallel
walk
design
pedestrians
walk
alongside
the
traffic
flow
A
leading
pedestrian
interval
may
be
provided
whereby
pedestrians
get
a
walk
signal
before
the
traffic
gets
a
green
light
allowing
pedestrians
to
establish
themselves
on
the
crossing
before
vehicles
begin
to
turn
to
encourage
drivers
to
give
way
A
walk
with
traffic
facility
allows
pedestrians
to
go
at
the
same
time
as
other
traffic
movements
with
no
conflict
between
movements
This
can
work
well
on
one
way
roads
where
turning
movements
are
banned
or
where
the
straight
ahead
movement
runs
in
a
different
stage
from
the
turning
movement
A
splitter
island
could
also
be
provided
Traffic
will
pass
on
either
side
of
the
island
and
pedestrians
can
cross
the
road
safely
between
the
other
flows
An
all
red
stage
also
known
as
a
full
pedestrian
stage
a
pedestrian
scramble
or
a
Barnes
Dance
b
holds
all
vehicular
traffic
at
the
junction
to
allow
pedestrians
time
to
safely
cross
without
conflict
from
vehicles
It
allows
the
use
of
diagonal
crossings
This
may
require
a
longer
cycle
time
and
increase
pedestrian
wait
periods
though
the
latter
can
be
eased
by
providing
two

In
some
jurisdictions
such
as
Australia
pedestrian
lights
are
associated
with
a
sound
device
for
the
benefit
of
blind
and
visually
impaired
pedestrians
These
make
a
slow
beeping
sound
when
the
pedestrian
lights
are
red
and
a
continuous
buzzing
or
fast
beeping
sound
when
the
lights
are
green
In
the
Australian
States
of
Queensland
New
South
Wales
Victoria
and
Western
Australia
the
sound
is
produced
in
the
same
unit
as
the
push
buttons
In
a
circle
above
the
button
on
a
PB
crossing
the
sound
is
produced
and
can
be
felt
along
with
a
raised
arrow
that
points
in
the
direction
to
walk
This
system
of
assistive
technology
is
also
widely
used
at
busy
intersections
in
Canadian
cities
In
the
United
Kingdom
the
Puffin
crossings
and
their
predecessor
the
Pelican
crossing
will
make
a
fast
beeping
sound
to
indicate
that
it
is
safe
to
cross
the
road
The
beeping
sound
is
disabled
during
the
nighttime
so
as
not
to
disturb
any
nearby
residents
In
some
states
in
the
United
States
at
some
busy
intersections
buttons
will
make
a
beeping
sound
for
blind
people
When
the
light
changes
a
speaker
built
into
the
button
will
play
a
recording
to
notify
blind
people
that
it
is
safe
to
cross
When
the
signal
flashes
red
the
recording
will
start
to
count
down
with
the
countdown
timer
In
several
countries
such
as
New
Zealand
technology
also
allows
deaf
and
blind
people
to
feel
when
lights
have
changed
to
allow
safe
crossing
A
small
pad
housed
within
an
indentation
in
the
base
of
the
box
housing
the
button
mechanism
moves
downwards
when
the
lights
change
to
allow
crossing
This
is
designed
to
be
felt
by
anyone
waiting
to
cross
who
has
limited
ability
to
detect
sight
or
sound
In
Japan
a
traffic
light
emits
an
electronic
sound
that
mimics
the
sound
of
birdsong
to
help
the
visually
impaired
Some
traffic
lights
fix
the
order
and
type
of
sound
so
that
they
can
tell
which
direction
is
a
green
light
In
general
Piyo

Piyo

which
is
a

and
Kakk
and
Ka

which
is

Where
cycle
lanes
or
cycle
tracks
exist
on
the
approach
to
a
signal
controlled
junction
it
must
be
considered
how
to
incorporate
cyclists
safely
into
the
junction
to
reduce
conflict
between
motor
vehicles
and
cyclists
An
advanced
stop
line
can
be
placed
after
the
stop
line
at
traffic
lights
This
allows
cyclists
to
position
themselves
in
front
of
traffic
at
a
red
light
and
get
a
headstart
In
the
US
design
advice
typically
advises
that
the
cycle
lane
should
continue
through
the
junction
to
the
left
of
the
right
turn
lane
however
this
creates
conflict
where
motor
vehicles
wish
to
enter
the
right
lane
as
they
must
cross
the
cycle
lane
at
a
bad
angle
Under
Dutch
engineering
principles
cyclists
are
instead
kept
to
the
right
of
the
junction
with
protected
kerbs
This
improves
safety
by
putting
cyclists
into
the
eyeline
of
motor
vehicles
at
the
stop
line
allowing
cyclists
a
headstart
over
turning
traffic
This
design
also
allows
cyclists
to
complete
far
side
turns
without
having
to
wait
in
the
centre
of
the
junction
UK
engineers
have
innovated
on
this
design
through
the
Cycle
Optimised
Protected
Signals
CYCLOPS
junction
e
g
in
Manchester
This
places
the
cycle
track
around
the
edge
of
the
signal
junction
and
gives
cyclists
and
pedestrians
a
single
all
red
phase
entirely
separate
from
motor
traffic
and
shortens
pedestrian
crossing
times
Alternatively
cyclists
can
be
considered
pedestrians
on
approach
to
a
junction
or
where
a
cycle
track
crosses
a

Preemption

edit
Main

Traffic
signal
preemption
and
Bus
priority
Some
regions
have
signals
that
are
interruptible
giving
priority
to
special
traffic
usually
emergency
vehicles
such
as
firefighting
apparatus
ambulances
and
police
cars
Most
of
the
systems
operate
with
small
transmitters
that
send
radio
waves
infrared
signals
or
strobe
light
signals
that
are
received
by
a
sensor
on
or
near
the
traffic
lights
Some
systems
use
audio
detection
where
a
certain
type
of
siren
must
be
used
and
detected
by
a
receiver
on
the
traffic
light
structure
Upon
activation
the
normal
traffic
light
cycle
is
suspended
and
replaced
by
the
preemption
sequence
the
traffic
lights
to
all
approaches
to
the
intersection
are
switched
to
red
with
the
exception
of
the
light
for
the
vehicle
that
has
triggered
the
preemption
sequence
Sometimes
an
additional
signal
light
is
placed
nearby
to
indicate
to
the
preempting
vehicle
that
the
preempting
sequence
has
been
activated
and
to
warn
other
motorists
of
the
approach
of
an
emergency
vehicle
The
normal
traffic
light
cycle
resumes
after
the
sensor
has
been
passed
by
the
vehicle
that
triggered
the
preemption
In
lieu
of
preemptive
mechanisms
in
most
jurisdictions
emergency
vehicles
are
not
required
to
respect
traffic
lights
Emergency
vehicles
must
slow
down
proceed
cautiously
and
activate
their
emergency
lights
to
alert
oncoming
drivers
to
the
preemption
when
crossing
an
intersection
against
the
light
Unlike
preemption
which
immediately
interrupts
a
signal
s
normal
operation
to
serve
the
preempting
vehicle
and
is
usually
reserved
for
emergency
use
priority
is
a
set
of
strategies
intended
to
reduce
delay
for
specific
vehicles
especially
mass
transit
vehicles
such
as
buses
A
variety
of
strategies
exist
to
give
priority
to
transit
but
they
all
generally
work
by
detecting
approaching
transit
vehicles
and
making
small
adjustments
to
the
signal
timing
These
adjustments
are
designed
to
either
decrease
the
likelihood
that
the
transit
vehicle
will
arrive
during
a
red
interval
or
decrease
the
length
of
the
red
interval
for
those
vehicles
that
are
stopped
Priority
does
not
guarantee
that
transit
vehicles
always
get
a
green
light
the
instant
they
arrive
as
preemption
does

A

of
different
control
systems
are
used
to
operate
signal
cycles
smoothly
ranging
from
simple
clockwork
mechanisms
to
sophisticated
computerised
control
systems
Computerised
systems
are
normally
actuated
i
e
controlled
by
loop
detectors
or
other
sensors
on

approaches
Area

Smart
traffic
light
systems
combine
traditional
actuation
a
wider
array
of
sensors
and
artificial
intelligence
to
further
improve
performance
of
signal
systems
A
traffic
signal
junction
or
crossing
is
typically
controlled
by
a
controller
mounted
inside
a
cabinet
nearby
Phases
or

groups
in
Australia
and
New
Zealand
are
indications
shown
simultaneously
e
g
multiple
green
lights
which
control
the
same
traffic
approach
A
movement
is
any
path
through
the
junction
which
vehicles
or
pedestrians
are
permitted
to
take
which
is
conflicting
if
these
paths
cross
one
another
A
stage
or
phase
in
ANZ
is
a
group
of
non
conflicting
phases
which
move
at
the
same
time
The
stages
are
collectively
known
as
a
cycle
The
time
between
two
conflicting
green
phases
is
called
an
intergreen
period
which
is
set
at
an
appropriate
length
for
the
junction
to
safely
clear
especially
for
turning
traffic
which
may
be
waiting
in
the
centre
of
the
junction
This
often
results
in
an
all
red
stage
when
all
approaches
are
shown
a
red
light
and
no
vehicle
can
proceed
This
all
red
is
sometimes
extended
to
allow
a
pedestrian
scramble
where
pedestrians
can
cross
the
empty
junction
in
any
direction
all
at
once
Some
signals
have
no

the
light
turns
green
for

the
instant
the

c
Many
traffic
light
installations
are
fitted
with
vehicle
actuation
i
e
detection
to
improve
the
flexibility
of
traffic
systems
to
respond
to
varying
traffic
flows
Detectors
come
in
the
form
of
digital
sensors
fitted
to
the
signal
heads
or
induction
loops
within
the
road
surface
Induction
loops
are
beneficial
due
to
their
smaller
chance
of
breakdown
but
their
simplicity
can
limit
their
ability
to
handle
some
situations
particularly
involving
lighter
vehicles
such
as
motorcycles
or
pedal
cycles
This
situation
most
often
occurs
at
times
of
day
when
other
traffic
is
sparse
as
well
as
when
the
small
vehicle
is
coming

A

The
timing
of
the
intergreen
is
usually
based
on
the
size
of
the
intersection
which
can
range
from
two
to
five
seconds
citation
needed
Modelling
programs
include
the
ability
to
calculate
intergreen
times
automatically
Intergreen
periods
are
determined
by
calculating
the
path
distance
for
every
conflict
point
in
the
junction
which
is
the
distance
travelled
to
the
conflict
point
by
the
movement
losing
right
of
way
minus
the
distance
travelled
to
the
same
conflict
point
by
the
movement
gaining
right
of
way
using
the
possible
conflict
points
including
with
pedestrians
and
calculating
both
the
time
it
would
take
the
last
vehicle
to
clear
the
furthest
collision
point
and
the
first
vehicle
from
the
next
stage
to
arrive
at
the
conflict
point
At
actuated
junctions
integreens
can
be
varied
to
account
for
traffic
conditions
Engineers
also
need
to
set
the
amber
timings
and
red
amber
where
appropriate
which
is
normally
standardised
by
a
traffic
authority
For
example
in
the
UK
the
amber
time
is
fixed
nationally
at
three
seconds
and
the
red
amber
time
at
two
seconds
which
results
in
a
minimum
intergreen
time
of
five
seconds
plus
any
all
red
time
The
US
also
uses
a
minimum
of
three
seconds
but
local
traffic
authorities
can
make
timings
longer
especially
on
wider
suburban
roads
This
variation
has
resulted
in
controversy
when
municipalities
with
shorter
amber
times
use
red
light
cameras
Where
pedestrian
signals
are
used
the
timing
of
the
inivitation
to
cross
the
period
where
a
steady
walk
signal
shows
and
clearance
periods
time
when
the
walk
signal
flashes
or
no
signal
is
shown
need
to
be
calculated
This
is
normally
set
against
a
design
speed
e
g
m
s
ft
s
Similarly
these
can
be
made
extendable
using
sensors
allowing
slower

pedestrians
more
time
to
cross
the
street
Design

Railroad
signals
for
stopping
trains
in
their
own

generally
use
the
opposite
positioning
of
the
colours
that
is
for

above
the

s
eyeline
green
on
top
and
red
below
is
the
standard
placement
of
the
signal
colours
on
railroad
tracks
There
are
three
reasons
for
this
variation
there
is
no
risk
that
railway
signals
will
be
masked
by
a
tall
vehicle
between
the
driver
and
the
signal
train
speeds
in
fog
are
much
higher
than
for
road
vehicles
so
it
is
important
that
the
most
restrictive
signal
is
closest
to
the
driver
s
eyeline
and
with
railway
signals
often
in
exposed
rural
locations
there
is
a
risk
of
any
signal
other
than
the
bottom

being
masked

Traffic

control
flows
of
traffic
using
social
norms
and
legal
rules
In
most
jurisdictions
it
is
against
the
law
to
disobey
traffic
signals
and
the
police
or
devices
such
as
red
light
cameras
can
issue
fines
or
other
penalties
and
in
some
cases
prosecute
drivers
who
break
those
laws
US
based
studies
have
found
that
the
majority
of
drivers
think
that
it
is
dangerous
to
run
a
red
light
at
speed
and
the
most
common
reason
for
red
light
running
include
inattentive
driving
following
an
oversized
vehicle
or
during
inclement
weather
The
rules
governing
traffic
light
junctions
for
vehicles
differ
by
jurisdiction
For
example
it
is
common
in
North
America
that
drivers
can
turn
kerb
to
kerb
i
e
turning
right
at
most
junctions
even
when
a
red

shows
This
turn
on
red
rule
is
uncommon
in
Europe
unless
an
arrow
signal
or
traffic
sign
specifically
permits
it
Design
edit
Bulbs
edit
Conventional
traffic
signal
lighting
still
common
in
some
areas
uses
a
standard
light
bulb
The
light
then
bounces
off
a
mirrored
glass
or
polished
aluminium
reflector
bowl
and
out
through
a
polycarbonate
plastic
or
glass
signal
lens
In
some
signals
these
lenses
were
cut
to
include
a
specific
refracting
pattern
Traditionally
incandescent
and
halogen
bulbs
were
used
Because
of
the
low
efficiency
of
light
output
and
a
single
point
of
failure
filament
burnout
some
traffic
authorities
are
choosing
to
retrofit
traffic
signals
with
LED
arrays
that
consume
less
power
have
increased
light
output
and
last
significantly
longer
citation
needed
In
the
event
of
an
individual
LED
failure
the
aspect
will
still
operate
albeit
with
a
reduced
light
output
The
light
pattern
of
an
LED
array
can
be
comparable
to
the
pattern
of
an
incandescent
or
halogen
bulb
fitted
with
a
prismatic
lens
The
low
energy
consumption
of
LED
lights
can
pose
a
driving
risk
in
some
areas
during
winter
Unlike
incandescent
and
halogen
bulbs
which
generally
get
hot
enough
to
melt
away
any
snow
that
may
settle
on
individual
lights
LED

In
the
United
States
traffic
lights
are
currently
designed
with
lights
approximately
inches
mm
in
diameter
Previously
the
standard
had
been
inches
mm
however
those
are
slowly
being
phased
out
in
favour
of
the
larger
and
more
visible
inch
lights
Variations
used
have
also
included
a
hybrid
design
which
had
one
or
more
inch
lights
along
with
one
or
more

even
when
not

reflecting
from

to
the

a
traditional
incandescent

in
a

This
cured

This

through
the

Signals
can
either
be
placed
nearside
between
the
stop
line
and
the
kerbline
of
the
intersecting
road
or
farside
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
junction
In
European
countries
signals
are
often
placed
on
the
nearside
In
the
UK
at
least
two
signal
heads
are
required
known
as
the
primary
and
secondary
heads
one
of
which
is
normally
nearside
and
the
other
of
which
could
be
nearside
or
farside
In
the
US
signals
are
normally
located
farside
though
in
some
states
nearside
signals
are
also
used
Nearside
signals
can
be
beneficial
to
road
safety
as
drivers
have
more
time
to
see
a
red
light
and
are
less
likely
to
encroach
on
pedestrian
crossings
Effects
edit
Drivers
spend
on
average
around
of
journey
time
passing
through
signalised
junctions
Traffic
lights
can
increase
the
traffic
capacity
at
intersections
and
reduce
delay
for
side
road
traffic
but
can
also
result
in
increased
delay
for
main
road
traffic
Hans
Monderman
the
innovative
Dutch
traffic
engineer
and
pioneer
of
shared
space
schemes
was
sceptical
of
their
role
and
is
quoted
as
having
said
of
them
We
only
want
traffic
lights
where
they
are
useful
and
I
haven
t
found
anywhere
where
they
are
useful
yet
A
World
Economic
Forum
study
found
that
signalised
junctions
are
linked
to
higher
rates
of
localised
air
pollution
Drivers
accelerate
and
stop
frequently
at
lights
and
as
such
peak
particle
concentration
can
be
around
times
higher
than
during
free
flow
conditions
The
WEF
recommends
that
traffic
authorities
synchronise
traffic
signals
consider
alternative
traffic
management
systems
and
consider
placing
traffic
lights
away
from
residential
areas
schools
and
hospitals
The
separation
of
conflicting
streams
of
traffic
in
time
can
reduce
the
chances
of
right
angle
collisions
by
turning
traffic
and
cross
traffic
but
they
can
increase
the
frequency
of
rear
end
crashes
by
up
to
Since
right
angled
and
turn
against
traffic
collisions
are
more
likely
to
result
in
injuries
this
is
often
an
acceptable
trade
off
They
can
also
adversely
affect
the
safety
of
bicycle
and
pedestrian
traffic

as
to
standards
concerning

is
issued
by

Administration
FHWA
of

Department
of
Transportation
USDOT
In
the
United

the
criteria
for
installation
of
a
traffic
control
signal
are
prescribed
by
the
Manual
on
Uniform
Traffic
Control

which
defines
the
criteria
in
nine

Installing
a
traffic
control
signal
at
some
intersections
might
be
justified
to
encourage
concentration
and
organisation
of
traffic
flow
on
a
roadway
network
Intersection
near
a
grade
crossing
A
traffic
control
signal
is
often
justified
at
an
intersection
near
a
railroad
crossing
in
order
to
provide
a
preemption
sequence
to
allow
traffic
queued
up
on
the
tracks
an
opportunity
to
clear
the
tracks
before
the
train
arrives
In
the
US
an
intersection
is
usually
required
to
meet
one
or
more
of
these
warrants
before
a
signal
is
installed
However
meeting
one
or
more
warrants
does
not
require
the
installation
of
a
traffic
signal
it
only
suggests
that
they
may
be
suitable
It
could
be
that
a
roundabout
would
work
better
There
may
be
other
unconsidered
conditions
that
lead
traffic
engineers
to
conclude
that
a
signal
is
undesirable
For
example
it
may
be
decided
not
to
install
a
signal
at
an
intersection
if
traffic
stopped
by
it
will
back
up
and
block
another
more
heavily
trafficked
intersection
Also
if
a
signal
meets
only
the
peak
hour
warrant
the
advantages
during
that
time
may
not
outweigh
the
disadvantages
during
the
rest
of
the
day

In
other
contexts

The
symbolism
of
a
traffic
light
and
the
meanings
of
the
three
primary
colours
used
in
traffic
lights
are
frequently
found
in
many
other
contexts
Since
they
are
often
used
as
single
spots
of
colour
without
the
context
of
vertical
position
they
are
typically
not
comprehensible
to
up
to
one
in
ten
males
who
are
colour
blind
citation
needed
Traffic
lights
have
also
been
used
in
computer
software
such
as
the
macOS
user
interface
and
in
pieces
of
artwork
particularly
Traffic
Light
Tree
in
London
UK
Racing

Racing
flags
Automobile
racing
circuits
can
also
use
standard
traffic
signals
to
indicate
to
racing
car
drivers
the
status
of
racing
On
an
oval
track
four
sets
may
be
used
two
facing
a
straight
away
and
two
facing
the
middle
of
the
degree
turn
between
straight
away
Green
would
indicate
racing
is
underway
while
amber
would
indicate
to
slow
or
while
following
a
pace
car
red
would
indicate
to
stop
probably
for
emergency
reasons
Scuderia
Ferrari
a
Formula
One
racing
team
formerly
used
a
traffic
light
system
during
their
pit
stops
to
signal
to
their
drivers
when
to
leave
the
pits
citation
needed
The
red
light
was
on
when
the
tires
were
being
changed
and
fuel
was
being
added
amber
was
on
when
the
tires
were
changed
and
green
was
on
when
all
work
was
completed
The
system
is
usually
completely
automatic
However
the
system
was
withdrawn
after
the
Singapore
Grand
Prix
due
to
the
fact
that
it
heavily
delayed
Felipe
Massa
during
the
race
when
he
was
in
the
lead
Usually
the
system
was
automatic
but
heavy
traffic
in
the
pit
lane
forced
the
team
to
operate
it
manually
A
mechanic
accidentally
pressed
the
green
light
button
when
the
fuel
hose
was
still
attached
to
the
car
causing
Massa
to
drive
off
towing
the
fuel
hose
along
Additionally
Massa
drove
into
the
path
of
Adrian
Sutil
earning
him
a
penalty
He
finally
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
pit
lane
forcing
Ferrari
s
mechanics
to
sprint
down
the
whole
of
the
pit
lane
to
remove
the
hose
As
a
result
of
this
and
the
penalty
he
also
incurred
Massa
finished
th
Ferrari
decided
to
use
a
traditional
lollipop
for
the
remainder
of
the
season
Another
type
of
traffic
light
that
is
used
in
racing
is
the
Christmas
Tree
which
is
used
in
drag
racing
The
Christmas
Tree
has
six
lights
a
blue
staging
light
three
amber
lights
a
green
light
and
a
red
light
The
blue
staging
light
is
divided
into
two
parts
Pre
stage
and
stage
Sometimes
there
are
two
sets
of
bulbs
on
top
of
each
other
to
represent
them
Once
a
driver
is
staged
at
the
starting
line
then
the
starter
will
activate
the
light
to
commence
racing
which
can
be
done
in
two
ways
If
a
Pro
tree
is
used
then
the
three
amber
lights
will
flash
at
the
same
time
For
the
Sportsman
tree
the
amber
light
will
flash
from
top
to
bottom
When
the
green
light
comes
up
the
race
officially
begins
but
if
a
driver
crosses
the
line
before
that
happens
then
a
red
light
will
come
up
and
that
will
be
a
foul
citation
needed
As
a
rating
mechanism
edit
See
also
Traffic
light
rating
system
and
European
Union
energy
label
The
colours
red
amber
and
green
are
often
used
as
a
simple
to
understand
rating
system
for
products
and
processes
It
may
be
extended
by
analogy
to
provide
a
greater
range
of
intermediate
colours
with
red
and
green
at
the
extremes
In
Unicode

the
symbol
for

A
HORIZONTAL

is

Notes
edit
Not
completely
correct
a
variable
speed
sign
is
not
solely
used
for
the
purpose
of
slowing
the
speed
of
motorists
approaching
an
intersection
They
are
also
used
on
freeways
where
the
maximum
safe
speed
is
dependent
on
the
conditions
of
the
roadway
i
e
weather
falling
rocks
risk
of
wildlife
etc
such
as
in
British
Columbia
Canada
clarification
needed
The
Barnes
Dance
is
named
after
an
American
traffic
engineer
Henry
A
Barnes
Barnes
did
not
claim
to
have
invented
the
system
but
was
a
strong
advocate
of
it
having
observed
the
difficulties
his
daughter
faced
crossing
the
road
to
get
to
school
These
are
typically
older
signals
There
are
many
examples
in
Houston
Texas
of
this
Suspended
lights
constructed
so
that
a
single
source
simultaneously
illuminates
all
four
directions
always
have
this
characteristic
Red
in
two
directions
and
green
in
the
two
cross
directions
with
Red
Yellow
Green
sequence
on
two
sides
and
Green

sequence
on

Note
The
origin
of
robot
used
as
traffic
light
is
from
the
English
translation
of
the
play
R
U
R
by
Karel
apek
which
debuted
in
England
in
and
introduced
the
term
robot
to
an
English
audience
For
a
short
time
in
England
it
was
fashionable
to
use
robot
for
traffic
light
from
the
late
s
when
traffic
lights
were
being
installed
in
England
This
usage
travelled
to
South
Africa
in
the
early
s
when
they
had
their
first
traffic
lights
installed
and
where
it
continues
to
be
used
almost
years
later
while
robot
for
traffic
light
fell
out
of
usage
in
England

How

how
are
new
design
innovations
shaping
interiors
in
spain
gif
Innovation
is
at
the
core
of
architecture
expressed
through
new
approaches
to
design
material
experimentation
and
of
course
ways
of
living
As
a
result
the
conception
of
buildings
and
indoor
spaces
is
constantly
evolving
This
evolution
is
especially
evident
in
regions
with
a
rich
cultural
heritage
such
as
Spain
where
innovation
reinterprets
traditional
ways
of
relating
to
space
This
attentiveness
to
memory
and
daily
life
extends
into
interiors
where
each
intervention
has
the
potential
to
actively
reshape
how
people
experience
a
space
and
open
new
possibilities
for
living
and
interaction

Asking
questions
is
the
first
step
toward
challenging
what
we
take
for
granted
and
opening
up
new
possibilities
for
planning
and
building
These
questions
valuable
in
themselves
gain
new
strength
when
shared
and
examined
through
different
perspectives
As
they
intersect
with
the
experiences
of
professionals
and
brands
they
weave
together
viewpoints
that
enrich
the
discussion
Design
fairs
and
events
around
the
world
have
become
spaces
where
these
conversations
gain
momentum
fostering
connections
and
encouraging
collaborative
dynamics
In
this
landscape
Colombia
has
emerged
as
a
hub
serving
as
a
platform
that
promotes
architecture
and
design
across
Latin
America
and
the
Caribbean
while
bringing
the
region
s
voice
to
the
global

Sometimes

solutions
are
the
most
revolutionary
and
impactful
During
Brazil
s
energy
crisis
in
mechanic
Alfredo
Moser
developed
an
accessible
and
effective
way
to
illuminate
indoor
spaces
during
the
day
Using
only
a
PET
bottle
installed
on
the
roof
filled
with
water
and
bleach
he
harnessed
the
refraction
of
sunlight
to
bring
brightness
to
spaces
previously
immersed
in
darkness
In
self
built
homes
where
successive
extensions
often
compromise
natural
light
and
ventilation
this
solution
makes
a
significant
difference
Named
the
Moser
lamp
the
invention
produces
illumination
equivalent
to
a
W
bulb
and
gained
worldwide
recognition
through
various
reports
Since
then
the
project
has
continued
to
evolve
and
adapt
to
the
needs
of
modern
communities
transforming

through
a

that

When
designing
and
lighting
a
space
is
the
goal
to
fulfill
a
specific
requirement
or
to
be
creative
Both
perspectives
hold
merit
however
a
unifying
principle
should
always
prevail
people
must
remain
at
the
center
of
everything
we
do
Today
it
is
well
understood
that
our
environment
significantly
influences
our
well
being
affecting
mood
and
performance
even
in
challenging
contexts
such
as
outer
space
While
this
standpoint
has
encompassed
anthropometric
and
biological
aspects
new
approaches
are
expanding

tangible

The
Pantheon
in
Rome
is
a
true
architectural
masterpiece
and
holds
the
title
of
the
largest
unreinforced
concrete
dome
in
the
world
Among
its
most
remarkable
elements
is
the
central
oculus
an
meter
wide
opening
at
the
top
of
the
dome
that
allows
natural
light
to
enter
This
creates
a
dynamic
play
of
light
and
shadow
that
shifts
throughout
the
day
enhancing
the
grandeur
of
the
structure
Beyond
its
practical
function
the
oculus
establishes
a
symbolic
connection
between
the
earthly
and
the
divine
reflecting
the
Pantheon
s
original
purpose
as
a
temple
dedicated
to

which

with

Bofill
Graves
and
Le
Corbusier
are
architects
renowned
for
their
exceptional
and
sensitive
use
of
color
In
their
approaches
color
takes
on
an
importance
comparable
almost
to
functionality
achieved
through
a
nuanced
and
comprehensive
perception
of
their
context
But
what
is
color
From
a
technical
standpoint
it
is
a
visual
perception
that
arises
from
the
interaction
of
light
with
our
eyes
and
brain
However
when
we
explore
its
meaning
on
a
more
emotional
and
poetic
level
it
takes
on
a
deeper
significance
For
Ricardo
Bofill
color
infuses
life
into
architecture
while
for
Charles
douard
Jeanneret
better
known
as
Le
Corbusier
it
serves
as
a
powerful
tool
to
evoke
emotions
and
create
spatial
illusions
In
Polychromie
Architecturale
Le
Corbusier
argues
that
color
is
not
only
a
decorative
element
but
also
a
fundamental
tool
for
creating
environments
and
enhancing
the
functionality
of
architectural
spaces
This
idea
developed
between
and
is
articulated
around
a
system
composed
of
a
range
of
colors
where
each
tone
has
its
relevance
and
contributes
to
creating
atmospheres
that
transcend
mere
architectural
design

When

the
image
that
typically
comes
to

is
an
exotic
space
characterized
by
perpetual
warmth
and
humidity
with
frequent
and
heavy
rainfall
nurturing
lush
vegetation
Throughout
history
this
tropical
climate
has
been
romanticized
as
a
paradise
and
criticized
for
potentially
fostering
weakness
due
to
its
perceived
clemency
Thankfully
those
judgments
and
associations
have
been
relegated
to
the
past
paving
the
way
for
theoretical
and
practical
projects
that
outline
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
living
in
a
tropical

These
projects
acknowledge

Textures

in
shaping

According
to
Pallasmaa
contemporary

neglecting

Gaslighting
Reviewed
by
Psychology
Today
Staff
Gaslighting
is
an
insidious
form
of
manipulation
and
psychological
control
Victims
of
gaslighting
are
deliberately
and
systematically
fed
false
information
that
leads
them
to
question
what
they
know
to
be
true
often
about
themselves
They
may
end
up
doubting
their
memory
their
perception
and
even
their
sanity
Over
time
a
gaslighter
s
manipulations
can
grow
more
complex
and
potent
making
it
increasingly
difficult
for
the
victim
to
see
the
truth

How
Gaslighting
Works

The
term
gaslighting
comes
from
a
play
Gas
Light
and
its
film
adaptation
Gaslighting
can
occur
in
personal
or
professional
relationships
and
victims
are
targeted
at
the
core
of
their
being
their
sense
of
identity
and
self
worth
Manipulative
people
who
engage
in
gaslighting
do
so
to
attain
power
over
their
victims
either
because
they
simply
derive
warped
enjoyment
from
the
act
or
because
they
wish
to
emotionally
physically
or
financially
control
their
victim
How
does
gaslighting
begin
BUTTON
Created
with
Sketch
A
relationship
with
a
gaslighter
may
seem
to
start
out
quite
well
They
may
praise
their
target
on
a
first
date
and
immediately
confide
in
them
Such
disclosure
before
any
intimacy
has
been
established
establishes
trust
quickly
it
s
part
of
a
tactic
known
as
love
bombing
The
more
quickly
a
victim
becomes
enamored
the
more
quickly
the
next
phase
of
manipulation
can
begin
What
are
a
gaslighter
s
tactics
BUTTON
Created
with
Sketch
A
gaslighter
will
initially
lie
about
simple
things
but
the
volume
of
misinformation
soon
grows
and
the
gaslighter
may
accuse
the
victim
of
lying
if
he
or
she
questions
the
narrative
They
typically
deploy
occasional
positive
reinforcement
to
confuse
the
victim
and
keep
them
off
balance
but
at
the
same
time
they
may
attempt
to
turn
others
against
the
victim
even
their
own
friends
and
family
by
telling
them
that
the
victim
has
been
lying
or
is
delusional
How
do
you
know
that
you
re
being
gaslighted
BUTTON
Created
with
Sketch
Self
doubt
may
rise
as
the
gaslighter
insists
that
what
the
victim
remembers
thinks
and
feels
is
wrong
The
manipulative
individual
may
then
introduce
lies
in
more
sensitive
arenas
aiming
to
disrupt
and
distort
foundational
aspects
of
the
victim
s
being
wearing
them
down
establishing
confusion
and
forcing
them
to
rely
on
the
gaslighter
s
version
of
reality
Is
gaslighting
ever
unintentional
BUTTON
Created
with
Sketch
It
is
possible
for
an
individual
to
manipulate
someone
without
realizing
they
are
doing
so
Importantly
though
the
person
still
enjoys
wielding
control
over
the
mind
and
behavior
of
the
victim
even
if
they
cannot
articulate
or
acknowledge
it
Some
people
engage
in
manipulative
behavior
because
they
witnessed
it
frequently
as
a
child
most
often
in
their
parents
Regardless
of
a
gaslighter
s
level
of
self
awareness
though
the
behavior
is
never
acceptable
and
ignorance
of
its
manipulative
effects
should
not
be
accepted
as
an
excuse
What
is
medical
gaslighting
BUTTON
Created

Medical
gaslighting
refers
to
a
scenario
in
which
a
medical
provider
ignores
or
downplays
an
individual
s
legitimate
medical
concerns
This
is
a
colloquial
use
of
the
term
gaslighting
and
often
refers
to
situations
in
which
a
medical
provider
may
not
actually
intend
to
mislead
or
manipulate
a
patient
rather
they
failed
to
take
the
patient
s
concerns
seriously

How
to
Recognize
a
Gaslighter
Olena

Gaslighting
can
be
more
effective
and
successful
than
many
people
imagine
and
almost
anyone
can
be
susceptible
to
gaslighting
tactics
which
have
been
deployed
throughout
history
and
continue
to
be
used
today
by
domestic
abusers
dictators
narcissists
and
cult
leaders
The
most
effective
gaslighters
are
often
the
hardest
to
detect
they
may
be
better
recognized
by
their
victims
actions
and
mental
state
Who
becomes
a
gaslighter
BUTTON
Created
with
Sketch
Those
who
employ
this
tactic
often
have
a
personality
disorder
narcissistic
personality
disorder
and
psychopathy
chief
among
them
Manipulators
have
a
tendency
to
present
one
face
to
their
target
and
another
to
the
rest
of
the
world
leading
victims
to
assume
that
if
they
ask
for
help
or
speak
out
no
one
will
believe
that
they
have
been
emotionally
abused
Gaslighters
typically
repeat
their
tactics
across
several
relationships
What
s
the
difference
between
gaslighting
and
manipulation
BUTTON
Created
with
Sketch
Manipulation
is
a
key
part
of
gaslighting
but
manipulation
is
a
fairly
common
tactic
that
almost
anyone
is
capable
of
employing
while
gaslighting
and
gaslighters
are
more
rare
Children
for
example
try
to
manipulate
parents
at
an
early
age
and
marketers
aim
to
manipulate
consumers
but
gaslighting
involves
a
pattern
of
abusive
behaviors
with
the
intent
not
just
to
influence
someone
but
actually
to
control
them
What
s
the
difference
between
gaslighting
and
narcissism
BUTTON
Created
with
Sketch
A
narcissist
may
be
self
promoting
and
feel
superior
to
others
a
gaslighter
aims
to
make
another
person
question
their
own
self
value
Gaslighting
can
sometimes
be
a
tactic
employed
by
someone
with
a
narcissistic
personality
but
it
is
not
a
core
trait
of
narcissistic
personality
disorder
Leaving
a
Gaslighter
wavebreakmedia
Shuterstock
A
primary
goal
of
a
gaslighter
is
to
keep
their
victim
hooked
If
a
victim
disagrees
with
or
questions
the
abuser
he
or
she
may
try
to
make
it
seem
as
if
they
themselves
are
being
victimized
by
the
target
Alternately
they
may
try
to
lure
a
reluctant
partner
back
to
them
through
positive
reinforcement
Many
people
eventually
find
a
way
to
escape
a
gaslighter
s
influence
leaving
the
manipulator
to
search
for
a
new
victim
often
research
suggests
they
already
have
a
target
in
mind
What
is
hoovering
BUTTON
Created
with
Sketch
When
someone
tries
to
leave
them
a
gaslighter
may
turn
to
the
tactic
of
hoovering
which
takes
its
name
from
the
vacuum
cleaner
brand
A
hoovering
gaslighter
will
tell
the
victim
how
much
they
love
him
or
her
and
praise
all
of
their
positive
qualities
They
may
also
explain
how
things
are
going
to
change
between
them
But
soon
after
the
victim
agrees
to
stay
things
tend
to
go
back
to
the
way
they
were
How
does
gaslighting
change
a
victim
BUTTON
Created
with
Sketch
Gaslighting
can
be
psychologically
devastating
It
violates
trust
and
upends
an
individual
s
view
that
people
are
generally
good
potentially
making
them
suspicious
of
everyone
close
to
them
Falling
victim
to
a
gaslighter
also
erodes
a
person
s
trust
in
themselves
and
makes
them
forget
what
they
once
valued
about
themselves
after
all
it
s
easy
to
blame
themselves
for
having
been
too
trusting
vulnerable
or
dependent
The
experience
makes
some
victims
never
want
to
be
part
of

Diwali
developed
over
centuries
from
local

that
occur
on
the
days
surrounding
the
new

day
of
Karttika
The
most
ancient
mention
of
the

can
be
found
in
the

In

it
is
called
Yaksharatri

also
mentioned
in

various
versions
of
a

Although
the

vary
in
these
ancient
texts
the
general
sense
of
the
modern
five
day
Diwali
festival
and
the
different
meanings
of
the
days
can
be
discerned
from
their
accounts
For
example
multiple
Puranas
suggest
that
the
lamps
are
lit
in
worship
of
Yama
god
of
the
dead
on
the
day
preceding

The
Tower
of
Hercules
lighthouse
in
north
western
Spain
Before
the
development
of
clearly
defined
ports
mariners
were
guided
by
fires
built
on
hilltops
Since
elevating
the
fire
would
improve
visibility
placing
the
fire
on
a
platform
became
a
practice
that
led
to
the
development
of
the
lighthouse
In
antiquity
the
lighthouse
functioned
more
as
an
entrance
marker
to
ports
than
as
a
warning
signal
for
reefs
and
promontories
unlike
many
modern
lighthouses
The
most
famous
lighthouse
structure
from
antiquity
was
the
Pharos
of
Alexandria
Egypt
which
collapsed
following
a
series
of
earthquakes
between
and
The

other
evidence
about
lighthouses

in
depictions
on
coins
and
mosaics
of
which
many
represent
the
lighthouse
at
Ostia
Coins
from
Alexandria
Ostia
and
Laodicea
in
Syria
also
exist
Modern
construction
edit
The
modern
era
of
lighthouses
began
at
the
turn
of
the
th
century
as
the
number
of
lighthouses
being
constructed
increased
significantly
due
to
much
higher
levels
of
transatlantic
commerce
Advances
in
structural
engineering
and
new
and
efficient
lighting
equipment
allowed
for
the
creation
of
larger
and
more
powerful
lighthouses
including
ones
exposed
to
the
sea
The
function
of
lighthouses
was
gradually
changed
from
indicating
ports
to
the
providing
of
a
visible
warning
against
shipping
hazards
such
as
rocks
or
reefs

Original
Winstanley
lighthouse
Eddystone
Rock
by
Jaaziell
Johnston
The
Eddystone
Rocks
were
a
major
shipwreck
hazard
for
mariners
sailing
through
the
English
Channel
The
first
lighthouse
built
there
was
an
octagonal
wooden
structure
anchored
by
iron
stanchions
secured
in
the
rock
and
was
built
by
Henry
Winstanley
from
to
His
lighthouse
was
the
first
tower
in
the
world
to
have
been
fully
exposed
to
the
open
sea
The
civil
engineer
John
Smeaton
rebuilt
the
lighthouse
from
to
his
tower
marked
a
major
step
forward
in
the
design
of
lighthouses
and
remained
in
use
until
He
modeled
the
shape
of
his
lighthouse
on
that
of
an
oak
tree
using
granite
blocks
He
rediscovered
and
used
hydraulic
lime
a
form
of
concrete
that
will
set
under
water
used
by
the
Romans
and
developed
a
technique
of
securing
the
granite
blocks
together
using
dovetail
joints
and
marble
dowels
The
dovetailing
feature
served
to
improve
the
structural
stability
although
Smeaton
also
had
to
taper
the
thickness
of
the
tower
towards
the
top
for
which
he
curved
the
tower
inwards
on
a
gentle
gradient
This
profile
had
the
added
advantage
of
allowing
some
of
the
energy
of
the
waves
to
dissipate
on
impact
with
the
walls
His
lighthouse
was
the
prototype
for
the
modern
lighthouse
and
influenced
all
subsequent
engineers

This
represented
a

One
such
influence
was
Robert
Stevenson
himself
a
seminal
figure
in
the
development
of
lighthouse
design
and
construction
His
greatest
achievement
was
the
construction
of
the
Bell
Rock
Lighthouse
in
one
of
the
most
impressive
feats
of
engineering
of
the
age

This
structure
was
based
upon
Smeaton
s
design
but
with
several
improved
features
such
as
the
incorporation
of
rotating
lights
alternating
between
red
and
white
Stevenson
worked
for
the
Northern
Lighthouse
Board
for
nearly
fifty
years
during
which
time
he
designed
and
oversaw
the
construction
and
later
improvement
of
numerous
lighthouses
He
innovated
in
the
choice
of
light
sources
mountings
reflector
design
the
use
of
Fresnel
lenses
and
in
rotation
and
shuttering
systems
providing
lighthouses
with
individual
signatures
allowing
them
to
be
identified
by
seafarers
He
also
invented
the
movable
jib
and
the

Until
the
source
of
illumination
had
generally
been
wood
pyres
or
burning
coal
The
Argand
lamp
invented
in
by
the
Swiss
scientist
Aim
Argand
revolutionized
lighthouse
illumination
with
its
steady
smokeless
flame
Early
models
used
ground
glass
which
was
sometimes
tinted
around
the
wick
Later
models
used
a
mantle
of
thorium
dioxide
suspended
over
the
flame
creating
a
bright
steady
light
The
Argand
lamp
used
whale
oil
colza
olive
oil
or
other
vegetable
oil
as
fuel
supplied
by
a
gravity
feed
from
a
reservoir
mounted
above
the
burner
The
lamp
was
first
produced
by
Matthew
Boulton
in
partnership
with
Argand
in
and
became
the
standard
for
lighthouses
for
over
a
century
Souter
Lighthouse
was
the
first
lighthouse
to
be
built
for
the
purpose
of
electric
illumination
in
South
Foreland
Lighthouse
was
the
first
tower
to
successfully
use
an
electric
light
in
The
lighthouse

John
Richardson
Wigham
was
the
first
to
develop
a
system
for
gas
illumination
of
lighthouses
His
improved
gas
crocus
burner
at

The
use
of
gas
as
illuminant
became
widely
available
with
the
invention
of

Gustaf
Dal
n
He
used
Agamassan
Aga
a
substrate
to
absorb

Diagram
depicting
how
a
spherical
Fresnel
lens
collimates
light
With
the
development
of
the
steady
illumination
of
the
Argand
lamp
the
application
of
optical
lenses
to
increase
and
focus
the
light
intensity
became
a
practical
possibility
William
Hutchinson
developed
the
first
practical
optical
system
in
known
as
a
catoptric
system
This
rudimentary
system
effectively
collimated
the
emitted
light
into
a
concentrated
beam
thereby
greatly
increasing
the
light
s
visibility
The
ability
to
focus
the
light
led
to
the
first
revolving
lighthouse
beams
where
the
light
would
appear
to
the
mariners
as
a
series
of
intermittent
flashes
It
also
became
possible
to
transmit
complex
signals
using
the
light
flashes
French
physicist
and
engineer
Augustin
Jean
Fresnel
developed
the
multi
part
Fresnel
lens
for
use
in
lighthouses
His
design
allowed
for
the
construction
of
lenses
of
large
aperture
and
short
focal
length
without
the
mass
and
volume
of
material
that
would
be
required
by
a
lens
of
conventional
design
A
Fresnel
lens
can
be
made
much
thinner
than
a
comparable
conventional
lens
in
some
cases
taking
the
form
of
a
flat
sheet
A
Fresnel
lens
can
also
capture
more
oblique
light
from
a
light
source
thus
allowing
the
light
from
a
lighthouse
equipped
with
one
to
be
visible
over
greater
distances
The
first
Fresnel
lens
was
used
in
in
the
Cordouan
lighthouse
at
the
mouth
of
the
Gironde
estuary
its
light
could
be
seen
from
more
than
miles
km
out
Fresnel
s
invention
increased
the
luminosity
of
the
lighthouse
lamp
by
a
factor
of
four
and
his
system
is
still
in
common
use
Modern
lighthouses
edit
The
introduction
of
electrification
and
automatic
lamp
changers
began
to
make
lighthouse
keepers
obsolete
For
many
years
lighthouses
still
had
keepers
partly
because
lighthouse
keepers
could
serve
as
a
rescue
service
if
necessary
Improvements
in
maritime
navigation
and
safety
such
Global
Positioning
System
GPS
led
to
the
phasing
out
of
non
automated
lighthouses
across
the
world
Although
several
closed
due
to
safety
concerns
Canada
still
maintains
staffed
lighthouses
split
roughly
evenly
across
east
and
west
coasts
including
Machias
Seal
Island
which
is
staffed
to
assert
Canadian
sovereignty
The
remaining
modern
lighthouses
are
usually
illuminated
by
a
single
stationary
flashing
light
powered
by
solar
charged
batteries
and
mounted
on
a
steel
skeleton
tower
Where
the
power
requirement
is
too
great
for
solar
power
alone
cycle
charging
of
the
battery

Diesel
generator
is

only
comes
into
use
when

Technology
edit
In
a
lighthouse
the
source
of
light
is
called
the
lamp
whether
electric
or
fuelled
by
oil
and
the
light
is
concentrated
if
needed
by
the
lens
or
optic
Power

Power
edit
Originally
lit
by
open
fires
and
later
candles
the
Argand
hollow
wick
lamp
and
parabolic
reflector
were
introduced
in
the
late
th
century
Whale
oil
was
also
used
with
wicks
as
the
source
of
light
Kerosene
became
popular
in
the
s
and
electricity
and
acetylene
gas
derived
on
site
from
calcium
carbide
began
replacing
kerosene
around
the
turn
of
the
th
century
Carbide
was
promoted
by
the
Dal
n
light
which
automatically
lit
the
lamp
at
nightfall
and
extinguished
it
at
dawn
In
the
second
half
of
the
th
century
many
remote
lighthouses
in
Russia
then
Soviet
Union
were
powered
by
radioisotope
thermoelectric
generators
RTGs
These
had
the
advantage
of
providing
power
day
or
night
and
did
not
need
refuelling
or
maintenance
However
after
the
collapse
of
the
Soviet
government
in
s
most
of
the
official
records
on
the
locations
and
condition
of
these
lighthouses
were
reportedly
lost
Over
time
the
condition
of
RTGs
in
Russia
degraded
many
of
them
fell
victim
to
vandalism
and
scrap
metal
thieves
who
may
not
have
been
aware
of
the
dangerous
radioactive
contents
Energy

Light

Many
Fresnel
lens
installations
have
been
replaced
by
rotating
aerobeacons
which
require
less
maintenance
In
modern
automated
lighthouses
the
system
of
rotating
lenses
is
often
replaced
by
a
high
intensity
light
that
emits
brief
omnidirectional
flashes
concentrating
the
light
in
time
rather
than
direction
These
lights
are
similar
to
obstruction
lights
used
to
warn
aircraft
of
tall
structures
Later
innovations
were
Vega
Lights
and
experiments
with
light
emitting
diode
LED
panels
LED
lights
which
use
less
energy
and
are
easier
to
maintain
had
come
into
widespread
use
by
In
the
United
Kingdom
and
Ireland
about
a
third
of
lighthouses
had
been
converted
from
filament
light
sources
to
use
LEDs
and
conversion
continued
with
about
three
per
year
The
light
sources
are
designed
to
replicate
the
colour
and
character
of
the
traditional
light
as
closely
as
possible
The
change
is
often
not
noticed
by
people
in
the
region
but
sometimes
a
proposed
change
leads
to
calls
to
preserve
the
traditional
light
including
in
some
cases
a
rotating
beam
A
typical
LED
system
designed
to
fit
into
the
traditional
th
century
Fresnel
lens
enclosure
was
developed
by
Trinity
House
and
two
other
lighthouse
authorities
and
costs
about
depending
on
configuration
according
to
a
supplier
it
has
large
fins
to
dissipate
heat
Lifetime
of
the
LED

is
to
hours
compared
to
about
hours
for
a

Experimental

at
high
power
to
provide
a
line
of
light
in
the
sky
or
utilising
low
power
aimed
towards
mariners
have
identified
problems
of
increased
complexity
in
installation
and
maintenance
and
high
power
requirements
The
first
practical
installation
in
at
Point
Danger
lighthouse
Queensland
was
replaced
by
a
conventional
light
after
four
years
because
the
beam
was
too
narrow
to
be
seen
easily
Light
characteristics
edit
See
also
Light
characteristic
In
any
of
these
designs
an
observer
rather
than
seeing
a
continuous
weak
light
sees
a
brighter
light
during
short
time
intervals
These
instants
of
bright
light
are
arranged
to
create
a
light
characteristic
or
pattern
specific
to
a
lighthouse
For
example
the
Scheveningen
Lighthouse
flashes
are
alternately
and
seconds
Some
lights
have
sectors
of
a
particular
color
usually
formed
by
colored
panes
in
the
lantern
to
distinguish
safe
water
areas
from
dangerous
shoals
Modern
lighthouses
often
have
unique
reflectors
or
racon
transponders
so
the
radar
signature
of
the
light
is
also
unique

Fresnel
lens
Before
modern
strobe
lights
lenses
were
used
to
concentrate
the
light
from
a
continuous
source
Vertical
light
rays
of
the
lamp
are
redirected
into
a
horizontal
plane
and
horizontally
the
light
is
focused
into
one
or
a
few
directions
at
a
time
with
the
light
beam
swept
around
As
a
result
in
addition
to
seeing
the
side
of
the
light
beam
the
light
is
directly
visible
from
greater
distances
and
with
an
identifying
light
characteristic
This
concentration
of
light
is
accomplished
with
a
rotating
lens
assembly
In
early
lighthouses
the
light
source
was
a
kerosene
lamp
or
earlier
an
animal
or
vegetable
oil
Argand
lamp
and
the
lenses
rotated
by
a
weight
driven
clockwork
assembly
wound
by
lighthouse
keepers
sometimes
as
often
as
every
two
hours
The
lens
assembly
sometimes
floated
in
liquid
mercury
to
reduce
friction
In
more
modern
lighthouses
electric
lights
and
motor
drives
were
used
generally
powered
by
diesel
electric
generators
These
also
supplied
electricity
for
the
lighthouse
keepers
Efficiently
concentrating
the
light
from
a
large
omnidirectional
light
source
requires
a
very
large
diameter
lens
This
would
require
a
very
thick
and
heavy
lens
if
a
conventional
lens
were
used
The
Fresnel
lens
pronounced
fre
n
l
focused
of
a
lamp
s
light
versus
the
focused
with
the
parabolic
reflectors
of
the
time
Its
design
enabled
construction
of
lenses
of
large
size
and
short
focal
length
without
the
weight
and
volume
of
material
in
conventional
lens
designs
Fresnel
lighthouse
lenses
are
ranked
by
order
a
measure
of
refracting
power
with
a
first
order
lens
being
the
largest
most
powerful
and
expensive
and
a
sixth
order
lens
being
the
smallest
The
order
is
based
on
the
focal
length
of
the
lens
A
first
order
lens
has
the
longest
focal
length
with
the
sixth
being
the
shortest
Coastal
lighthouses
generally
use
first
second
or
third
order
lenses
while
harbor
lights
and
beacons
use
fourth
fifth
or
sixth
order
lenses

While
lighthouse
buildings
differ
depending
on
the
location
and
purpose
they
tend
to
have
common
components
A
light
station
comprises
the
lighthouse
tower
and
all
outbuildings
such
as
the
keeper
s
living
quarters
fuel
house
boathouse
and
fog
signaling
building
The
Lighthouse
itself
consists
of
a
tower
structure
supporting
the
lantern
room
where
the
light
operates
The
lantern
room
is
the
glassed
in
housing
at
the
top
of
a
lighthouse
tower
containing
the
lamp
and
lens
Its
glass
storm
panes
are
supported
by
metal
muntins
glazing
bars
running
vertically
or
diagonally
At
the
top
of
the
lantern
room
is
a
stormproof
ventilator
designed
to
remove
the
smoke
of
the
lamps
and
the
heat
that
builds
in
the
glass
enclosure
A
lightning
rod
and
grounding
system
connected
to
the
metal
cupola
roof
provides
a
safe
conduit
for
any
lightning
strikes
Immediately
beneath
the
lantern
room
is
usually
a
Watch
Room
or
Service
Room
where
fuel
and
other
supplies
were
kept
and
where
the
keeper
prepared
the
lanterns
for
the
night
and
often
stood
watch
The
clockworks
for
rotating
the
lenses
were
also
located
there
On
a
lighthouse
tower
an
open
platform
called
the
gallery
is
often
located
outside
the
watch
room
called
the
Main
Gallery
or
Lantern
Room
Lantern
Gallery
This
was
mainly
used
for
cleaning
the
outside
of
the
windows
of
the
Lantern
Room
Lighthouses
near
to
each
other
that
are
similar
in
shape
are
often
painted
in
a
unique
pattern
so
they
can
easily
be
recognized
during
daylight
a
marking
known
as
a
daymark
The
black

For
effectiveness
the

must
be
high
enough
to
be
seen
before

the

Where
dangerous
shoals
are
located
far
off
a
flat
sandy
beach
the
prototypical
tall
masonry
coastal
lighthouse
is
constructed
to
assist
the
navigator
making
a
landfall
after
an
ocean
crossing
Often
these
are
cylindrical
to
reduce
the
effect
of
wind
on
a
tall
structure
such
as
Cape
May
Light
Smaller
versions
of
this
design
are
often
used
as
harbor
lights
to
mark
the
entrance
into
a
harbor
such
as
New
London
Harbor
Light
Where
a
tall
cliff
exists
a
smaller
structure
may
be
placed
on
top
such
as
at
Horton
Point
Light
Sometimes
such
a
location
can
be
too
high
for
example
along
the
west
coast
of
the
United
States
where
frequent
low
clouds
can
obscure
the
light
In
these
cases
lighthouses
are
placed
below
the
clifftop
to
ensure
that
they
can
still
be
seen
at
the
surface
during
periods
of
fog
or
low
clouds
as
at
Point
Reyes
Lighthouse
Another
example
is
in
San
Diego
California
the
Old
Point
Loma
lighthouse
was
too
high
up
and
often
obscured
by
fog
so
it
was
replaced

Allah
s
Light
Described
The
light
of
Allah
as
described
in
the
hadith
and
Qur
an
Abu
Musa
reported
The
Messenger
of
Allah
was
standing
amongst
us
and
he
told
us
five
things
He
said
Verily
the
Exalted
and
Mighty
God
does
not
sleep
and
it
does
not
befit
Him
to
sleep
He
lowers
the
scale
and
lifts
it
The
deeds
in
the
night
are
taken
up
to
Him
before
the
deeds
of
the
day
and
the
deeds
of
the
day
before
the
deeds
of
the
night
His
veil
is
the
light
In
the
hadith
narrated
by
Abu
Bakr
instead
of
the
word
light
it
is
fire
If
he
withdraws
it
the
veil
the
splendor
of
His
countenance
would
consume
His
creation
so
far
as
His
sight
reaches
Musa
as
was
the
only
Prophet
to
have
spoken
with
Allah
and
in
his
conversation
He
asked
if
he
could
see
him
And
when
Moses
arrived
at
Our
appointed
time
and
his
Lord
spoke
to
him
he
said
My
Lord
show
me
Yourself
that
I
may
look
at
You
Allah
said
You
will
not
see
Me
but
look
at
the
mountain
if
it
should
remain
in
place
then
you
will
see
Me
But
when
his
Lord
appeared
to
the
mountain
He
rendered
it
level
and
Moses
fell
unconscious
And
when
he
awoke
he
said
Exalted
are
You
I
have
repented
to
You
and
I
am
the
first
of
the
believers
Qur
an
So
we
learn
that
Allah
s
light
is
too
powerful
to
be
witnessed
Vision
perceives
Him
not
but
He
perceives
all
vision
and
He
is
the
Subtle
the
Acquainted
Qur
an
The
Various
Interpretations
It
may
be
obvious
but
worth
mentioning
When
we
say
Allah
is
Al
Nur
The
Light
it
is
not
meant
in
the
literal
sense
The
light
we
see
is
created
and
is
not
eternal
It
gets
emitted
absorbed
reflected
and
refracted
Most
scholars
agree
for
it
to
be
a
name
and
attribute
of
Allah
it
must
be
understood
by
the
consequence
and
the
properties
of
light
Light
illuminates
makes
things
visible
and
shows
the
way
through
the
darkness
This
leads
to
many
interpretations
of
the
name
An
Nur
which
we
ll
explore
in
detail
The
first
understanding
is
through
His
ability
to
manifest
creation
Darkness
is
the
absence
of
light
when
we
have
no
light
what
remains
is
darkness
Similarly
it
can
be
said
if
something
did
not
exist
it
was
hidden
or
unknown
Allah
has
the
power
to
make
them
visible
or
known
by
creating
them
It
may
seem
paradoxical
but
the
natural
state
of
existence
is
nothingness
We
cannot
fathom
what
absolute
nothingness
is
but
that
s
the
state
from
which
all
things
come
it
s
the
origin
People
mistakenly
assume
that
life
is
just
the
arrangement
of
atoms
and
molecules
but
who
created
the
atoms
and
molecules
Who
was
responsible
for
its
perfect
orderly
arrangement
What
keeps
everything
going
and
allows
them
to
remain
The
only
logical
conclusion
to
this
question
is
Allah
Without
Him
saying
kun
fa
yakoon
Be
and
it
is
Qur
an
they
would
not
be
known
A
second
interpretation
is
light
manifests
it
makes
things
that
are
hidden
visible
His
light
operates
at
many
levels
There
is
nothing
that
can
be
hidden
from
Him
He
is
the
Al
Baseer
All
Seeing
and
As
Sami
All
Hearing
His
light
reveals
and
nothing
escapes
His
view
And
with
Him
are
the
keys
of
the
unseen
none
knows
them
except
Him
And
He
knows
what
is
on
the
land
and
in
the
sea
Not
a
leaf
falls
but
that
He
knows
it
Qur
an
He
also
illuminates
mankind
through
His
book
and
His
Messengers
may
peace
be
upon
them
He
s
a
guide
to
those
lost
So
in
this
sense
He
lights
upon
light
From
the
darkness
of
nonexistence
to
the
light
of
existence
from
unguided
to
guided

The
Darkness
Within
Allah
describes
Himself
in
verse
of
Surah
Nur
as
the
light
of
the
heaven
and
the
earth
Everything
that
comes
from
Him
comes
through
His
light
To
contrast
Shaykh
Tosun
Bayrak
mentions
how
the
light
of
faith
eliminates
the
darknesses
of
infidelity
and
sin
within
and
without
bringing
us
to
the
light
of
Truth
and
salvation
and
serenity
The
devil
and
one
s
own
devil
the
ego
are
those
who
like
to
operate
in
darkness
and
enter
dark
houses
they
will
not
enter
that
Divine
house
the
heart
illuminated
by
the
light
of
Faith
The
darkness
in
the
believer
is
their
ego
It
calls
us
to
pursue
pleasure
and
things
prohibited
to
pull
us
from
Allah
We
can
bring
light
into
our
life
and
the
world
by
and
large
through
following
the
commandments
of
Allah
By
keeping
ties
of
kinship
spreading
peace
oppressing
evils
gift
giving
feeding
friends

neighbors
praying
salah
remembering
Him
in
our
prayers
giving
zakat
to
the
needy
being
patient
practicing
gratitude
respecting
and
upholding

rights

This
is

Reflecting
on
your
light
Every
person
has
a
light
that
emanates
from
them
The
intensity
at
which
it
shines
is
determined
by
their
upright
character
and
the
righteousness
of
their
deeds
Every
good
you
do
illuminates
the
path
toward
paradise
and
every
evil
takes
from
it
The
intention
of
the
believer
then
should
be
to
focus
on
ways
in
which
their
being
is
like
a
moth
to
a
flame
attracting
others
because
of
their
light
and
goodness

How
to
Lighten
Your
Heavy
Heart
Courtney

How
to
Lighten
Your
Heavy
Heart
When
our
minds
are
busy
we
can
be
easily
overwhelmed
and
distracted
but
our
brains
usually
find
a
way
to
process
and
release
Our
hearts
on
the
other
hand
hold
everything
dearly
Our
hearts
hold
love
and
joy
but
they
also
hold
pain
worry
guilt
and
sadness
Our
hearts
helps
us
feel
all
the
things
and
not
just
our
own
things
Our
hearts
take
on
the
whole
world
Sometimes
it
s
too
much
though
and
all
of
those
feelings
get
heavy
When
our
hearts
overflow
with
the
heavy
stuff
we
ask
questions
like
Why
am
I
so
sad
Why
does
this
hurt
so
much
Will
I
get
through
this
When
will
I
feel
better
What
can
I
do
Or
instead
of
asking
the
questions
we
shut
down
Our
hearts
close
for
business
for
a
while
and
we
disconnect
from
all
the
feelings
even
the
good
ones
It
s
in
that
time
that
we
usually
become
apathetic
depressed
lonely
or
hopeless
The
heart
wants
what
the
heart
wants
but
there
are
ways
to
soothe
your
soul
and
to
lighten
your
heavy
heart
Write
down
your
heart
This
is
almost
always
my
first
response
to
pain
grief
sadness
or
any
strong
emotion
or
reaction
I
ve
learned
from
experience
that
acting
from
an
unstable
place
generally
leads
to
overreacting
and
words
I
wished
I
never
said
out
loud
Instead
I
put
my
heart
on
paper
first
I
write
it
all
down
Even
if
it
sounds
crazy
or
messy
I
don
t
judge
I
just
write
Expression
will
lighten
your
heavy
heart
Find
the
blessings
In
every
tragedy
or
painful
time
there
are
blessings
They
don
t
justify
the
pain
but
when
you
keep
your
heart
open
to
the
goodness
you
can
see
the
way
through
Whatever
your
struggle
is
today
claim
your
openness
to
the
blessings
that
have
yet
to
appear
and
then
give
them
room
to
rush
in
Hope
will
lighten
your
heavy
heart
Make
time
to
heal
The
best
strategies
in
the
world
will
not
speed
up
the
healing
process
You
need
time
and
there
is
no
good
answer
to
how
long
It
will
take
as
long
as
it
takes
You
can
t
rush
your
heart
We
said
goodbye
to
our
sweet
dog
Guinness
more
than
months
ago
My
heart
is
lighter
than
it
was
in
the
days
that
followed
that
painful
goodbye
but
there
are
still
days
when
I
get
teary
or
really
really
miss
him
Patience
will
lighten
your
heavy
heart
Take
action
When
you
feel
hopeless
or
helpless
taking
action
helps
Give
your
time
talent
and
treasure
with
the
intention
of
relieving
someone
s
pain
In
a
recent
essay
author
Elizabeth
Gilbert
said
But
when
the
world
starts
to
feel
overwhelming
in
its
sorrows
I
always
ask
myself
to
look
around
me
to
narrow
down
my
focus
and
to
notice
somebody
who
is
nearby
me
who
is
suffering
I
can
t
help
the
millions
but
maybe
I
can
help
one
You
never
have
to
look
very
far
to
find
a
suffering
soul
Give
in
the
best
way
you
can
and
don
t
let
anyone
tell
you
your
gift
isn
t
enough
It
is
Contribution
will
lighten
your
heavy
heart
Share
your
heart
Call
a
friend
Share
something
on
your
favorite
social
platform
Reach
out
and
share
your
heart
Give
others
a
chance
to
say
yes
me
too
Solidarity
will
lighten
your
heavy
heart
If
your
heart
is
heavy
today
and
it
s
too
soon
to
consider
these
recommendations
come
back
when
you
re
ready
In
the
meantime
be
open
to
the
light
and
look
for
the
stars

the
things
that

When
you
re
with
friends
maybe
even
neighbors
and
the
invitation
to
play
is
just
that
an
invitation
And
everybody
is
there
for
no
other
reason
than
to
have
fun
together
You
become
lighthearted
And
the
light
of
your
lighthearted
heart
is
shared
A
weight
is
lifted
A
separation
healed
A
connection
made
visible
It
becomes
a
light
that
illuminates
everything
You
feel
a
certain
trust
in
each
other
a
certain
certainty
People
are
there
because
they
want
to
be
They
want
to
play
together
And
when
someone
for
some
reason
doesn
t
want
to
play
it
s
as
valid
a
response
to
the
invitation
as
playing
is
Any
question
about
this
being
a
good
use
of
time
is
answered
by
the
fun
people
are
having
The
relevance
of
it
all
to
you
and
to
the
community
is
everywhere
manifest
You
are
each
having
fun
together
No
further
explanation
needed
The
value
to
yourself
and
to
the
community
is
self
evident
every
moment
of
every
game
even
when
all
you
re
doing
is
watching
or
hanging
out
in
the
kitchen
talking
It
s
freedom
is
what
it
is
It
s
community
It
s
well
like
being
in
love
with
people
who
love
you
so
to
speak
in
a
way
And
because
the
kids
are
around
you
re
feeling
all
that
without
drugs
without
alcohol
even
So
nothing
can
come
between
you
and
the
authenticity
of
your
experience
It
s
really
you
Really
them
It
s
magic
is
what
it
is
this
shared
light
this
heart
The
fun
of
it
all
is
so
much
more
encompassing
simply
because
you
re
doing
it
freely
together
in
full
consciousness
wholeheartedly
and
wholebodily
This
is
the
way
it
is
when
you
come
together
to
for
fun
You
let
loose
You
let
the
light
of
being
together
into
your
very
heart
You
let
the
fun
in
You
let
each
other
in
Laughing
hearts
Loving
hearts
Light
hearts
Much
very
much
to
the
delight
of
all
