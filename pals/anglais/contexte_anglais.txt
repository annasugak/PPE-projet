The
Astronomer
s
Unit
for
Measuring
Distance
distance
better
adapted
to
the
scale
of
the
Universe
quickly
became
a
necessity
One
unit
of
distance
commonly
used
in
astronomy
is
the
light
year
A
light
year
is
the
distance
travelled
by
light
in
one
year
which
is
trillion
billion
million
thousand
and
kilometres
In
other
words
almost
billion
kilometres
The
creation
of
this
unit
of
distance
was
not
accomplished
overnight
It
was
first
necessary
to
determine
the
speed
of
light
in
order
to
know
the
distance
that
it
will
travel
in
one
year
Before
most
scientists
thought
that
light
moved
instantaneously
from
one
point
to
another
In
that
year
however
the
Danish
physicist
Ole
Christensen
R
mer
was
the
first
to
demonstrate
that
light
had
a
finite
speed
Painted
portrait
of
a
man
with
a
full
head
of
very
long
curly
hair
and
In
the
French
astronomer
Jean
Dominique
Cassini
for
whom
R
mer
was
an
assistant
proposed
that
the
difference
was
due
to
the
time
it
took
light
to
travel
from
Jupiter
to
Earth
However
he
quickly
changed
his
mind
and
abandoned
the
hypothesis
R
mer
on
the
other
hand
continued
to
pursue
the
idea
and
estimated
that
light
takes
minutes
to
travel
a
distance
equal
to
the
diameter
of
the
Earth
s
orbit
we
know
today
that
the
true
value
is
closer
to
minutes
and
seconds
If
R
mer
had
calculated
the
speed
of
light
using
his
data
he
would
have
come
up
with
an
answer
of
kilometres
per
second
which
is
about
half
the
accepted
value
today
of
It
was
only
in
that
the
majority
of
the
astronomical
community
were
finally
convinced
that
light
had
finite
speed
The
British
astronomer
James
Bradley
published
a
study
demonstrating
that
the
annual
variation
observed
in
the
position
of
the
stars
is
related
to
the
speed
of
light
He
estimated
that
light
travels
at
kilometres
per
second
which
is
very
close
to
the
accepted
value
In
the
German
astronomer
Friedrich
Wilhelm
Bessel
and
not
the
Scottish
astronomer
Thomas
Henderson
as
is
often
mentioned
was
the
first
to
use
the
light
year
as
a
unit
of
measurement
in
astronomy
He
measured
the
distance
separating
us
from
the
binary
star
Cygni
as
light
years
The
advantage
of
the
light
year
as
a
unit
of
measurement
is
not
only
that
it
quantifies
distance
but
that
it
also
provides
the
time
it
takes
for
light
to
reach
Earth
For
example
if
Cygni
is
light
years
from
Earth
kilometres
then
it
takes
it
s
light
years
to
reach
us
We
are
therefore
always
seeing
Cygni
as
it
was
more
than
years
ago
This
is
how
light
allows
us
to
see
into
the
past
and
why
a
telescope
is
really
a
type
of
time
travel
machine
This
concept
applies
equally
to
very
distant
galaxies
that
are
measured
at
distances
of
to
billion
light
years
they
appear
to
us
now
the
way
they
existed
to
billion
years
ago

short

The
light
year
represents
the
distance
it
takes
for
light
to
travel
in
a
vacuum
during
one
year
We
know
that
the
speed
of
light
is
times
centimetres
per
second
We
must
therefore
multiply
this
by
the
number
of
seconds
in
a
year
about
million
seconds
to
find
the
distance
travelled
by
this
light
the
distance
of
a
light
year
In
professional
astronomy
we
prefer
to
use
another
unit
called
the
parsec
which
is
equal
to
light
years
Professional
astronomers
will
speak
of
the
parsec
the
kiolparsec
and
the
megaparsec
more
than
they
do
of
light
years
but
think
of
it
as
a
unit
of
length
that
gives
us
a
typical
scale
for
the
distance
between
stars

A

at

End
of
the
Tunnel
Study
Finds
Even
Dying
Brains
May
Be
Conscious
There
have
been
many
theories
and
questions
that
go
unanswered
regarding
what
happens
when
a
person
dies
Some
people
who
have
had
near
death
experiences
reported
seeing
a
white
light
while
others
have
said
they
floated
above
their
bodies
and
saw
themselves
below
spiritual
experiences
and
that
these
experiences
are
associated
with
an
increased
activity
in
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
which
controls
the
fight
or
flight
response
in
the
body
Do
people
see
a
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
What
this
study
really
suggests
is
that
the
brain
is
undergoing
some
chemical
changes
during
the
dying
process
It
explains
the
perceptions
people
have
about
seeing
angels
or
light
at
the
end
of

Arthur
Caplan
a

stated
What
it
shows
is
that
the
brain
has
measures
that
it
takes
to
try
and
study
is
very
preliminary
and
doesn
t
go
down
that
road
In
some
ways
this
study
sheds
light
on
people
s
fear
that
maybe
they
re
going
to
suffer
when
they
re
dying
at
the
last
moment
and
that
doesn

to
be

The
speed
of
light
in
vacuum
is
defined
to
be
exactly
m
s
approximately
miles
per
second
The
fixed
value
of
the
speed
of
light
in
SI
units
results
from
the
fact
that
the
metre
is
now
defined
in
terms
of
the
speed
of
light
All
forms
of
electromagnetic
radiation
move
at
exactly
this
same
speed
in
vacuum
Different
physicists
have
attempted
to
measure
the
speed
of
light
throughout
history
Galileo
attempted
to
measure
the
speed
of
light
in
the
seventeenth
century
An
early
experiment
to
measure
the
speed
of
light
was
conducted
by
Ole
R
mer
a
Danish
physicist
in
Using
a
telescope
R
mer
observed
the
motions
of
Jupiter
and
one
of
its
moons
Io
Noting
discrepancies
in
the
apparent
period
of
Io
s
orbit
he
calculated
that
light
takes
about
minutes
to
traverse
the
diameter
of
Earth
s
orbit
However
its
size
was
not
known
at
that
time
If
R
mer
had
known
the
diameter
of
the
Earth
s
orbit
he
would
have
calculated
a
speed
of
m
s
Another
more
accurate
measurement
of
the
speed
of
light
was
performed
in
Europe
by
Hippolyte
Fizeau
in
Fizeau
directed
a
beam
of
light
at
a
mirror
several
kilometers
away
A
rotating
cog
wheel
was
placed
in
the
path
of
the
light
beam
as
it
traveled
from
the
source
to
the
mirror
and
then
returned
to
its
origin
Fizeau
found
that
at
a
certain
rate
of
rotation
the
beam
would
pass
through
one
gap
in
the
wheel
on
the
way
out
and
the
next
gap
on
the
way
back
Knowing
the
distance
to
the
mirror
the
number
of
teeth
on
the
wheel
and
the
rate
of
rotation
Fizeau
was
able
to
calculate
the
speed
of
light
as
m
s
L
on
Foucault
carried
out
an
experiment
which
used
rotating
mirrors
to
obtain
a
value
of
m
s
in
Albert
A
Michelson
conducted
experiments
on
the
speed
of
light
from
until
his
death
in
He
refined
Foucault
s
methods
in
using
improved
rotating
mirrors
to
measure
the
time
it
took
light
to
make
a
round
trip
from
Mount
Wilson
to
Mount
San
Antonio
in
California
The
precise
measurements
yielded
a
speed
of
m
s
The
effective
velocity
of
light
in
various
transparent
substances
containing
ordinary
matter
is
less
than
in
vacuum
For
example
the
speed
of
light
in
water
is
about
of
that
in
vacuum
Two
independent
teams
of
physicists
were
said
to
bring
light
to
a
complete
standstill
by
passing
it
through
a
Bose
Einstein
condensate
of
the
element
rubidium
one
team
at
Harvard
University
and
the
Rowland
Institute
for
Science
in
Cambridge
Massachusetts
and
the
other
at
the
Harvard
Smithsonian
Center
for
Astrophysics
also
in
Cambridge
However
the
popular
description
of
light
being
stopped
in
these
experiments
refers
only
to
light
being
stored
in
the
excited
states
of
atoms
then
re
emitted
at
an
arbitrary
later
time
as
stimulated
by
a
second
laser
pulse
During
the
time
it
had
stopped
it
had
ceased
to
be
light

The
study
of
light

of

Surface
scattering
A
transparent
object
allows
light
to
transmit
or
pass
through
Conversely
an
opaque
object
does
not
allow
light
to
transmit
through
and
instead
reflecting
or
absorbing
the
light
it
receives
Most
objects
do
not
reflect
or
transmit
light
specularly
and
to
some
degree
scatters
the
incoming
light
which
is
called
glossiness
Surface
scattering
is
caused
by
the
surface
roughness
of
the
reflecting
surfaces
and
internal
scattering
is
caused
by
the
difference
of
refractive
index
between
the
particles
and
medium
inside
the
object
Like
transparent
objects
translucent
objects
allow
light
to
transmit
through
but
translucent
objects
also
scatter
certain
wavelength
of
light
via
internal
scattering
viewed
from
a
shallow
angle
Refraction
is
the
bending
of
light
rays
when
passing
through
a
surface
between
one
transparent
material
and
another
It
is
described
by
Snell
s
Law
in
a
vacuum
and
n
in
a
transparent
substance
When
a
beam
of
light
crosses
the
boundary
between
a
vacuum
and
another
medium
or
between
two
different
media
the
wavelength
of
the
light
changes
but
the
frequency
remains
constant
If
the
beam
of
light
is
not
orthogonal
or
rather
normal
to
the
boundary
the
change
in
wavelength
results
in
a
change
in
the
direction
of
the
beam
This
change
of
direction
is
known
as
refraction
The
refractive
quality
of
lenses
is
frequently
used
to
manipulate
light
in
order
to
change
the
apparent
size
of
images
Magnifying
glasses
spectacles
contact
lenses
microscopes
and
refracting
telescopes
are
all
examples
of
this

of

sources
There
are
many
sources
of
light
A
body
at
a
given
temperature
emits
a
characteristic
spectrum
of
black
body
radiation
A
simple
thermal
source
is
sunlight

radiation
emitted
by
the

the
Sun

Solar
radiation

region
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
when
plotted
in
wavelength
units
and
roughly
of
the
radiation
that
reaches
the
ground
is
visible
Another
example
is
incandescent
light
bulbs
which
emit
only
around
of
their
energy
as
visible
light
and
the
remainder
as
infrared
A
common
thermal
light
source
in
history
is
the
glowing
solid
particles
in
flames
but
these
also
emit
most
of
their
radiation
in
the
infrared
and
only
a
fraction
in
the
visible
not
seen
in
stars
or
pure
thermal
radiation
Atoms
emit
and
absorb
light
at
characteristic
energies
This
produces
emission
lines
in
the
spectrum
of
each
atom
Emission
can
be
spontaneous
as
in
light
emitting
diodes
gas
discharge
lamps
such
as
neon
lamps
and
neon
signs
mercury
vapor
lamps
etc
and
flames
light
from
the
hot
gas
itself
so
for
example
sodium
in
a
gas
flame
emits
characteristic
yellow
light
Emission

also
be
stimulated
as
in
a
laser
or
a
microwave
maser

cyclotron

synchrotron
radiation
and
bremsstrahlung
radiation
are
all
examples
of
this
Particles
moving
through
a
medium
faster

the
speed
of

in

Cherenkov
radiation
Certain
chemicals
produce
visible
radiation
by
chemoluminescence
In
living
things
this
process
is
called
bioluminescence
For
example
fireflies
produce
light
by
this
means
and
boats
moving
through
water
can
disturb
plankton
which
produce
a
glowing
wake
Certain
substances
produce
light
when
they
are
illuminated
by
more
energetic
radiation
a
process
known
as
fluorescence
Some
substances
emit
light
slowly
after
excitation
by
more
energetic
radiation
This
is
known
as
phosphorescence
Phosphorescent
materials
can
also
be
excited
by
bombarding
them
with
subatomic
particles
Cathodoluminescence
is
one
example
This
mechanism
is
used
in

Photometry

Radiometry
Light
is
measured
with
two
main
alternative
sets
of
units
radiometry
consists
of
measurements
of
light
power
at
all
wavelengths
while
photometry
measures
light
with
wavelength
weighted
with
respect
to
a
standardized
model
of
human
brightness
perception
Photometry
is
useful
for
example
to
quantify
Illumination
lighting
intended
for
human
use
The
photometry
units
are
different
from
most
systems
of
physical
units
in
that
they
take
into
account
how
the
human
eye
responds
to
light
The
cone
cells
in
the
human
eye
are
of
three
types
which
respond
differently
across
the
visible
spectrum
and
the
cumulative
response
peaks
at
a
wavelength
of
around
nm
Therefore
two
sources
of
light
which
produce
the
same
intensity
W
m
of
visible
light
do
not
necessarily
appear
equally
bright
The
photometry
units
are
designed
to
take
this
into
account
and
therefore
are
a
better
representation
of
how
bright
a
light
appears
to
be
than
raw
intensity
They
relate
to
raw
power
by
a
quantity
called
luminous
efficacy

are
used

purposes
like
determining
how

Light
pressure
Main

Radiation
pressure
Light
exerts
physical
pressure
on
objects
in
its
path
a
phenomenon
which
can
be
deduced
by
Maxwell
s
equations
but
can
be
more
easily
explained
by
the
particle
nature
of
light
photons
strike
and
transfer
their
momentum
Light
pressure
is
equal
to
the
power
of
the
light
beam
divided
by
c
the
speed
of
light
Due
to
the
magnitude
of
c
the
effect
of
light
pressure
is
negligible
for
everyday
objects
For
example
a
one
milliwatt
laser
pointer
exerts
a
force
of
about
piconewtons
on
the
object
being
illuminated
thus
one
could
lift
a
billion
mW
laser
pointers
However
in
nanometre
scale
applications
such
as
nanoelectromechanical
systems
NEMS
the
effect
of
light
pressure
is
more
significant
and
exploiting
light
pressure
to
drive
NEMS
mechanisms
and
to
flip
nanometre
scale
physical
switches
in
integrated
circuits
is
an
active
area
of
research
At
larger
scales
light
pressure
can
cause

their
irregular
shapes

Although
the
motion
of
the
Crookes
radiometer
was
originally
attributed
to
light
pressure
this
interpretation
is
incorrect
the
characteristic
Crookes
rotation
is
the
result
of
a
partial
vacuum
This
should
not
be
confused
with
the
Nichols
radiometer
in
which
the
slight
motion
caused
by
torque
though
not
enough
for
full
rotation
against
friction
is
directly
caused
by
light
pressure
As
a
consequence
of
light
pressure
Einstein

predicted
the
existence
of

which
would
oppose

the
properties
of
light
Euclid
postulated
that

travelled
in

he
described
the
laws
of
reflection
and
studied
them
mathematically
He
questioned
that

is
the
result
of
a

from
In
BC
Lucretius
a
Roman
who
carried
on
the
ideas
of
earlier
Greek
atomists
wrote
that
The
light
heat
of

these
are

minute
atoms
which
when
they
are

off
lose
no

Classical

In
ancient
India
the
Hindu
schools
of
Samkhya
and
Vaisheshika
from
around
the
early
centuries
AD
developed
theories
on
light
According
to
the
Samkhya
school
light
is
one
of
the
five
fundamental
subtle
elements
tanmatra
out
of
which
emerge
the
gross
elements
The
atomicity
of
these
elements
is
not
specifically
mentioned
and
it
appears
that
they
were
actually
taken
to
be
continuous
The
Vishnu
Purana
refers
to
sunlight
as
the
seven
rays
of
the
sun
The
Indian
Buddhists
such
as
Dign
ga
in
the
fifth
century
and
Dharmakirti
in
the
seventh
century
developed
a
type
of
atomism
that
is
a
philosophy
about
reality
being
composed
of
atomic
entities
that
are
momentary
flashes
of
light
or
energy
They
viewed
light
as
being
an
atomic
entity
equivalent
to
energy
Descartes
Ren
Descartes
held
that
light
was
a
mechanical
property
of
the
luminous
body
rejecting
the
forms
of
Ibn
al
Haytham
and
Witelo
as
well
as
the
species
of
Roger
Bacon
Robert
Grosseteste
and
Johannes
Kepler
In
he
published
a
theory
of
the
refraction
of
light
that
assumed
incorrectly
that
light
travelled
faster
in
a
denser
medium
than
in
a
less
dense
medium
Descartes
arrived
at
this
conclusion
by
analogy
with
the
behaviour
of
sound

Although
Descartes
was
incorrect
about
the
relative
speeds
he
was
correct
in
assuming
that
light
behaved
like
a
wave
and
in
concluding
that
refraction
could
be
explained
by
the
speed
of
light
in
different
media
Descartes
is
not
the
first
to
use
the
mechanical
analogies

because
he
clearly
asserts
that
light
is
only
a
mechanical
property
of
the

the

an

Isaac
Newton
studied
Gassendi
s
work
at
an
early
age

preferred
his
view
to

stated
in

Hypothesis

was
composed

which
were
emitted
in
all

from

One
of
Newton
s
arguments
against
the
wave
nature
of
light
was
that
waves
were
known
to
bend
around
obstacles
while
light
travelled
only
in
straight
lines
He
did
however
explain
the
phenomenon
of
the
diffraction
of
light
which
had
been
observed
by
Francesco
Grimaldi
by
allowing
that
a
light
particle
could
create
a
localised
wave
in
the
aether
Newton
s
theory
could
be
used
to
predict
the
reflection
of
light
but
could
only
explain
refraction
by
incorrectly
assuming
that
light
accelerated
upon
entering
a
denser
medium
because
the
gravitational
pull
was
greater
Newton
published
the
final
version
of
his
theory
in
his
Opticks
of
His
reputation
helped
the
particle
theory
of
light
to
hold
sway
during
the
eighteenth
century
The
particle
theory
of
light
led
Pierre
Simon
Laplace
to
argue
that
a
body
could
be
so
massive
that
light
could
not
escape
from
it
In
other
words
it
would
become
what
is
now
called
a
black
hole
Laplace
withdrew
his
suggestion
later
after
a
wave
theory
of
light
became
firmly
established
as
the
model
for

been

coloured
receptors
in
the
eye
In
Andr
Marie
Amp
re
gave
Augustin
Jean
Fresnel
an
idea
that
the
polarization
of
light
can
be
explained
by
the
wave
theory
if
light
were
a
transverse
wave
Later
Fresnel
independently
worked
out
his
own
wave
theory
of
light
and
presented
it
to
the
Acad
mie
des
Sciences
in
Sim
on
Denis
Poisson
challenged
Fresnel
s
model
claiming
that
it
predicted
a
bright
spot
in
the
shadow
behind
a
circular
obstacle
experiment
that
showed
the
bright
spot
Poisson
s
challenge
became
new
evidence
for
the
wave
theory
In
Young
wrote
to
Arago
suggesting
that
light
must
be
transverse
waves
not
the
longitudinal
waves
characteristic
of
sound
Fresnel
took
up
the
idea
and
was
able
to
show
via
mathematical
methods
that
polarization
could
be
explained
by
a
transverse
wave
theory
of
light
with
no
longitudinal
vibration
The
weakness
of
the
wave
theory
was
that
light
waves
like
sound
waves
would
need
a
medium
for
transmission
The
existence
of
the
hypothetical
substance
luminiferous
aether
proposed
by
Huygens
in
was
cast
into
experiment
Newton
s
corpuscular
theory
implied
that
light
would
travel
faster
in
a
denser
medium
while
the
wave
theory
of
Huygens
and
others
implied
the
opposite
At
that
time
the
speed
of
light
could
not
be
measured
accurately
enough
to
decide
which
theory
was
correct
The
first
to
make
a
sufficiently
accurate
measurement
was
L
on
Foucault
in
In
Michael
Faraday
discovered
that
the
plane
of
polarization
of
linearly
polarized
light
is
rotated
when
the
light
rays
travel
along
the
magnetic
field
direction
in
the
presence
of
a
transparent
dielectric
an
effect
now
known
as
Faraday
rotation
This
was
the
first
evidence
that
light
was
related
to
electromagnetism
In
he
speculated
that
light
might
be
some
form
of
disturbance
propagating
along
magnetic
field
lines
Faraday
proposed
in
that
light
was
a
high
frequency
electromagnetic
vibration
which
could
propagate
even
in
the
absence
of
a
medium
such
as
the
ether
Faraday
s
work
inspired
James
Clerk
Maxwell
to
study
electromagnetic
radiation
and
light
Maxwell
discovered
that
self
propagating
electromagnetic
waves
would
travel
through
space
at
a
constant
speed
which
happened
to
be
equal
to
the
previously
measured
speed
of
light
From
this
Maxwell
concluded
that
light
was
a
form
of
electromagnetic
radiation
he
first
stated
this
result
in
in
On
Physical
Lines
of
Force
In
he
published
A
Treatise
on
Electricity
and
Magnetism
after
Heinrich
Hertz
confirmed
Maxwell
s
theory
experimentally
by
generating
and
detecting
radio
waves
in
the
laboratory
and
demonstrating
that
these
waves
behaved
exactly
like
visible
light
exhibiting
properties
such
as
reflection
refraction
diffraction
and
interference
Maxwell
s
theory
and
Hertz
s
experiments
led
directly
to
In
the
quantum
theory
photons
are
seen
as
wave
packets
of
the
waves
described
in
the
classical
theory
of
Maxwell
The
quantum
theory
was
needed
to
explain
effects
even
with
visual
light
that
Maxwell
s
classical
theory
could
not
such
as
spectral
lines
In
Max
Planck
attempting
to
explain
black
body
radiation
suggested
that
although
light
was
a
wave
these
waves
could
gain
or
lose
energy
only
in
finite
amounts
related
to
their
frequency
Planck
called
these
lumps
of
light
energy
quanta
from
a
Latin
word
for
how
much
In
Albert
Einstein
used
the
idea
of
light
quanta
to
explain
the
photoelectric
effect
and
suggested
that
these
light
quanta
had
a
real
existence
In
Arthur
Holly
Compton
showed
that
the
wavelength
shift
seen
when
low
intensity
X
rays
scattered
from
electrons
so
called
Compton
scattering
could
be
explained
by
a
particle
theory
of
X
rays
but
not
a
wave
theory
In
Gilbert
N
Lewis
named
these
light
quanta
particles
photons
Eventually
quantum
mechanics
came
to
picture
light
as
in
some
sense
both
a
particle
and
a
wave
and
in
another
sense
as
a
phenomenon
which
is
neither
a
particle
nor
a
wave
which
actually
are
macroscopic
phenomena
such
as
baseballs
or
ocean
waves
Instead
under
some
approximations
light
can
be
described
sometimes
with
mathematics
appropriate
to
one
type
of
macroscopic
metaphor
particles
and
sometimes
another
macroscopic
metaphor
waves
to
behave
more
like
a
classical
wave
at
lower
frequencies
but
more
like
a
classical
particle
at
higher
frequencies
but
never
completely
loses
all
qualities
of
one
or
the
other
Visible
light
which
occupies
a
middle
ground
in
frequency
can
easily
be
shown
in
experiments
to
be
describable
using
either
a
wave
or
particle
model
or
sometimes
both
In
Satyendra
Nath
Bose
showed
that
light
followed
different
statistics
from
that
of
classical
particles
With
Einstein
they
generalized
this
result
for
a
whole
set
of
integer
spin
particles
applied
quantum
theory
to
the
electromagnetic
field
in
the
s
and
s
to
gain
a
more
detailed
understanding
of
photodetection
and
the
statistics
of
light
see
degree
of
coherence
This
led
to
the
introduction
of
the
coherent
state
as
a
concept
which
addressed
variations
between
laser
light
thermal
light
exotic
squeezed
states
etc
as
it
became
understood
that
light
cannot
be
fully
described
just
referring
to
the
electromagnetic
fields
describing
the
waves
in
the
classical
picture
In
H
Jeff
Kimble
et
al
demonstrated
a
single
atom
emitting
one
photon
at
a
time
further
compelling
evidence
that
light
consists
of
photons
Previously
unknown
quantum
states
of
light
with
characteristics
unlike
classical
states
such
as
squeezed
light
were
subsequently
discovered
and
modelocking
techniques
opened
the
way
to
the
study
of
what
became
known
as
ultrafast
processes
Applications
for
solid
state
research
e
g
Raman
spectroscopy
were
found
and
mechanical
forces
of
light
on
matter
were
studied
The
latter
led
to
levitating
and
positioning
clouds
of
atoms
or
even
small
biological
samples
in
an
optical
trap
or
from
quantum
optics
partly
from
theoretical
computer
science
Use

Sunlight
provides
the
energy
that
green
plants
use
to
create
sugars
mostly
in
the
form
of
starches
which
release
energy
into
the
living
things
that

them
This
process
of
photosynthesis
provides
virtually
all
the
energy
used
by
living

Some
species
of
animals
generate
their

What
is
the
visible
light
spectrum
The
visible
light
spectrum
is
the
segment
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
that
the
human
eye
can
view
More
simply
this
range
of
wavelengths
is
called
visible
light
Typically
the
human
eye
can
detect
wavelengths
from
to
nanometers
WAVELENGTHS
OF
VISIBLE
LIGHT
All
electromagnetic
radiation
is
light
but
we
can
only
see
a
small
portion
of
this
radiation
the
portion
we
call
visible
light
Cone

As
the
full
spectrum
of
visible
light
travels
through
a
prism
the
wavelengths
separate
into
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
because
each
color
is
a
different
wavelength
Violet
has
the
shortest
wavelength
at
around
nanometers
and
red
has
the

human
An
optical
image
may
be
regarded
as
the
apparent
reproduction
of
an
object
by
a
lens
or
mirror
system
employing
light
as
a
carrier
An
entire
image
is
generally
produced
simultaneously
as
by
the
lens
in
a
camera
but
images
may
also
be
generated
sequentially
by
point
by
point
pictures
across
long
distances
in
space
Nevertheless
the
final
detector
of
all
images
is
invariably
the
human
eye
and
whatever
means
is
used
to
transmit
and
control
the
light
the
final
image
must
either
be
produced
simultaneously
or
scanned
so
rapidly
that
the
observer
s
persistence
of
vision
will
give
him
the
mental
impression
of
a
complete
vision
something
moved
from
the
object
to
the
eye
or
whether
something
reached
out
from
the
eye
to
the
object
By
the
beginning
of
the
th
century
however
it
was
known
that
rays
of
light
travel
in
straight
lines
and
in
Johannes
Kepler
a
German
astronomer
published
a
book
on
optics
in
which
he
postulated
that
an
extended
object
could
be
regarded
as
a
multitude
of
separate
points
each
point
emitting
rays
of
light
in
all
directions
Some
of
these
rays
would
enter
a
lens
by
which
they
would
be
bent
around
and
made
to
converge
to
a
point
the
image
of
the
object
point
whence
the
rays
originated
The
lens
of
the
by
aberrations
diffraction
or
even
defocussing
In
the
Italian
physicist
Vasco
Ronchi
went
the
other
way
and
defined
an
image
as
any
recognizable
nonuniformity
in
the
light
distribution
over
a
surface
such
as
a
screen
or
film
the
sharper
the
image
the
greater
the
degree
of
nonuniformity
Today
the
concept
of
an
image
often
departs
from
Kepler
s
idea
that
an
extended
object
can
be
regarded
as
innumerable
separate
points
of
light
and
it
is
sometimes
more
convenient
to
regard
an
image
as
being
composed
of
overlapping
patterns
of
varying
frequencies
and
contrasts
hence
the
quality
of
a
lens
can
be
information
and
communication
theory
which
is
treated
at
length
below
Light
rays
waves
and
wavelets
A
single
point
of
light
which
may
be
a
point
in
an
extended
object
emits
light
in
the
form
of
a
continually
expanding
train
of
waves
spherical
in
shape
and
centred
about
the
point
of
light
It
is
however
often
much
more
convenient
to
regard
an
object
point
as
emitting
fans
of
rays
the
rays
being
straight
lines
everywhere
perpendicular
to
the
waves
When
the
light
beam
is
refracted
by
a
lens
or
reflected
by
a
mirror
the
curvature
of
the
waves
is
changed
and
the
angular
divergence
of
the
ray
bundle
is
similarly
changed
in
such
a
perfect
point
and
the
emerging
waves
are
then
not
truly
spherical
In
Christiaan
Huygens
a
Dutch
scientist
postulated
that
a
light
wave
progresses
because
each
point
in
it
becomes
the
centre
of
a
little
wavelet
travelling
outward
in
all
directions
at
the
speed
of
light
each
new
wave
being
merely
the
envelope
of
all
these
expanding
wavelets
When
the
wavelets
reach
the
region
outside
the
outermost
rays
of
the
light
beam
they
destroy
each
other
by
mutual
interference
wherever
a
crest
of
one
wavelet
falls
upon
a
trough
of
another
wavelet
Hence
in
effect
no
waves
or
wavelets
are
allowed
to
exist
outside
the
geometrical
light
beam
defined
by
the
rays
The
normal
destruction
of
one
wavelet
by
another
which
serves
to
restrict
the
light
energy
to
the
region
of
the
rectilinear
ray
paths
however
breaks
down
when
the
light
beam
strikes
an
opaque
edge
for
the
edge
then
cuts
off
some
of
the
interfering
wavelets
allowing
others
to
exist
which
diverge
slightly
into
the
shadow
area
This
phenomenon
is
called
diffraction
and
it
gives
rise
to
a
complicated
fine
structure
at
the
edges
of

light
surrounding

George

The

The
Airy
disk
of
an

therefore
about

in

ten
times

wavelength

Nevertheless
the
Airy
disk
formed
by
a
telescope
or
microscope
objective
can
be
readily
seen
with
a
bright
point
source
of
light
if
a
sufficiently
high
eyepiece
magnification
is
used

This
works
out
at
about
four
and
a
half
seconds
of
arc
divided

the

of

objective
in
inches
As
noted
above
when
a
perfect
lens
forms
an
image
of
a
point
source
of
light
the
emerging
wave
is
a
sphere
centred
about
the
image
point
The
optical
paths
from
all
points
on
the
wave
to
the
image
are
therefore
equal
so
that
the
expanding
wavelets
are
all
in
phase
vibrating
in
are
then
not
all
equal
In
such
a
case
some
wavelets
will
reach
the
image
as
a
peak
some
as
a
trough
and
there
will
be
much
destructive
interference
leading
to
the
formation
of
a
sizable
patch
of
light
much
different
from
the
minute
Airy
disk
characteristic
of
a
perfectly
corrected
lens
In
Rayleigh
studied
the
effects

phase
will
not
be
seriously
degraded
unless
the
path
differences
between
one
part
of
the
wave
and
another
exceed
one
quarter
of
the
wavelength
of
light
As
this
difference
represents
only
micron
inch
it
is
evident
that
an
optical
system
must
be
designed
and
constructed
with
almost
superhuman

The
use
of
polished
mirrors
for
reflecting
light
has
been
known
for
thousands
of
years
and
concave
mirrors
have
long
been
used
to
form
real
images
of
distant
objects
Indeed
Isaac
Newton

preferred
of
a
mirror
all
large
telescopes
today
are
of
this
type
When
a
ray
of
light
is
reflected
at
a
polished
surface
the
angle
of
reflection
between
ray
and
normal
the
line
at

angles

equal

The
law
of
refraction
When
a
ray
of
light
meets
the
surface
of
separation
between
two
transparent
media
it
is
sharply
bent
or
refracted
Because
rays
are
really
only
directions
and
have
no
physical
existence
the
passage
of
light
waves
through
a
surface
must
be
considered
if
refraction
is
to
be
understood
Refraction
effects
are
based
on
the
fact
that
light
travels
more
slowly
in
a
denser
medium
The
ratio
of
the
velocity
of
light
in
air
to
its
velocity
in
the
medium
is
called
the
refractive
index
of
the
medium
for
light
of
a
particular
colour
or
wavelength
The
refractive
index
is

for

Total
internal
reflection
When
a
ray

light

the
angle
of

between

is
greater
than
the

at

limit
the
diameter

These

cells
of
various
kinds
in
which
either
a
voltage
or
a

is
modified
by
light
falling
on

Many
new
types
of
detectors
are

into

An
extreme
example
of
electro
optics
appears
in
some
space
cameras
in
which
the
film
is
exposed
processed
and
then
scanned
by
a
tiny
point
of
light
the
light
passing
through
the
film
is
picked
up
by
a
photocell
and
transmitted
to
Earth
by
radio
where
it
is
made
to
control
the
brightness
of
another
point
of
light
scanning
a
second
piece
of
film
in
exact
synchronism
with
the
scanning
spot
in
the
camera
The
whole
system
thus
produces
a
picture
on
Earth

is

Improved
screen
materials
have
been
developed
to
increase
the
brightness
of
the
picture
to
suit
the
particular
shape
of
the
auditorium
A
screen
covered
with
tiny
beads
tends
to
send
the
light
back
in
the
general
direction
of
the
projector
and
is
suitable
for
use
at
one
end
of
a
long
narrow
auditorium
Another
type
of
screen
is
covered
with
fine
embossed
vertical
grooves
this
tends
to
distribute
the
light
in
a
horizontal
band
across
the
audience
with
little
or
no
vertical
spread
A
real
advantage
of
these
highly
reflective
screens
is
that
they
tend
to
reflect
ambient
room
light
away
from
the
viewer
as
by
a
mirror
so
that
the
pictures
appear
almost
as
bright
and
clear
by
day
as
in
a
darkened
room
Reflecting
prisms
are
pieces
of
glass
bounded
by
plane
surfaces
set
at
carefully
specified
angles
Some
of
these
surfaces
transmit
light
some
reflect
light
while
some
serve
both
functions
in
succession
A
prism
is
thus
an
assembly
of
plane
reflectors
at
relatively
fixed
angles
which
are
traversed
in
succession
by
a
beam
of

The

glass

angles
and
one
at

The

Prisms
containing
a
semireflecting
semitransmitting
surface
are
known
as
beam
splitters
and
as
such
have
many
uses
An
important
application
is
found
in
some
colour
television
cameras
in
which
the
light
from
the
lens
is
divided
by
two
beam
splitters
in
succession
to
form
red
green
and
blue
images
on
the
faces
of
three
image
tubes
in
the
camera
There
are
two
forms
of
dispersing
element
used
to
spread
out
the
constituent
colours
of
a
beam
of
light
into
a
spectrum
namely
a
prism
and
a
grating
The
prism
known
to
Newton
is
the
older
it
separates
the
colours
of
the
spectrum
because
the
refractive
index
of
the
glass
is
lowest
for
red
light
and
progressively
increases
through
the
yellow
and
green
to
the
blue
where
it
is
highest
Prism
spectroscopes
and
spectrographs
are
made
in
a
variety
of
forms
and
having
many
thousands
of
fine
parallel
grooves
to
the
inch
It
separates
the
colours
of
the
spectrum
by
a
process
of
diffraction
Each
groove
diffracts
or
scatters
light
in
all
directions
and
in
the
case
of
light
of
one
particular
wavelength
there
will
be
one
direction
in
which
the
light
wave
from
one
groove
lags
behind
the
light
wave
from
the
next
groove
by
precisely
one
or
more
whole
wavelengths
This
results
in
a
strong
beam
of
diffracted
light
in
that
direction
and
darkness
in
all
other
directions
Since
each
spectral
colour
corresponds
to
a
different
wavelength
the
grating
spreads
out
the
A
colour
filter
is
a
sheet
of
transparent
material
that
modifies
a
light
beam
by
selective
absorption
of
some
colours
in
relation
to
others
A
neutral
filter
absorbs
all
wavelengths
equally
and
merely
serves
to
reduce
the
intensity
of
a
beam
of
light
without
changing
its
colour
gelatin
and
in
some
cases
glass
cells
filled
with
liquid
have
been
used
Since
World
War
II
another
type
of
filter
depending
on
the
interference
of
light
has
been
developed
in
which
one
or
more
metallic
or
other
types
of
films
of
controlled
thickness
have
been
deposited
on
a
glass
plate
the
layers
being
so
thin
as
to
cause
selective
instead
of
being
absorbed
Polarizing
filters
have
the
property
of
transmitting
light
that
vibrates
in
one
direction
while
absorbing
light
that
vibrates
in
a
perpendicular
direction
These
filters
are
used
extensively
in
scientific
instruments

As

a

of

material
transmits
light
by
repeated

when

Fresnel
lenses
have
been
used
in
lighthouses

s

With

Fresnel
lenses
are
often
source
lying
along
the
lens
axis
for
this
reason
they
are
commonly
referred
to
as
axicons
They
have
been
used
to
produce
a
straight
line
of
light
in
space
for
aligning
machines
and
shafting
but
since
about
the
beam
from
a
gas
laser
has
generally
been
used
instead
If
a
lens
were
perfect
and
the
object
were
a
single
point
of
monochromatic
light
then
as
noted
above
the
light
wave
emerging
from
the
lens
would
be
a
portion
of
a
sphere
centred
about
the
ideal
image
point
lying
in
the
paraxial
image
plane
at
a
height
above
the
axis
given
by
the
Lagrange
theorem
In
practice
however
this
condition
is
most
unlikely
to
occur
it
is
much
more
probable
that
the
emerging
wave
will
depart
slightly
from
a
perfect
sphere
the
departure
varying
from
point
to
point
over
the
lens
aperture
This
departure
is
extremely
small
being
of
the
order
of
the
wavelength
of
light
that
is
only
half
a
micron
so
it
would
be
impossible
to
show
this
departure
on
a
drawing

The
images
formed

all
the

zones
of

intensity
of
light
If

is
moved
along

axis
by
a

other

respond

if

low

problem
is
to
relate

has
to
travel
farther
than
the
axial

to
reach
a

then
it

The
net
result
is

The

of
light
on
the
other
side
of

In
this
case
however
the
exit
pupil
will
not
in
general
be
a
perfect
circle
because
of
possible
distortion
of
the
telescope
can
possibly
make
anything
appear
brighter

directly
To
be
sure
a

accepts
more
light
from

object
in
proportion
to
the

it
magnifies

area
in
the

proportion
so
the
increased
light
is
spread
over
an
increased
area
of
the
retina
and
the
illuminance
remains
unchanged
Actually
the
telescopic
view
is
always
dimmer
than
the
direct
view
because
of
light
losses
in
the
telescope
due
to
glass
absorption
and

reflections

The
case

star
appear

anything

than

star
images
appear
brighter
in

to

Light
travels
from
the

to
our

in
about

which
means
the

is
about

Sunlight
takes
about
minutes

What
is
faster
than
the
speed
of
light
Nothing
Light
is
a
universal
speed
limit
and
according
to
Einstein
s
theory
of
relativity
is
the
fastest
speed
in
the
universe
kilometers
per
second
miles
per

Is
the
speed
of
light
constant
The
speed
of
light
is
a
universal
constant
in
a
vacuum
like
the
vacuum
of
space
However
light
can
slow
down
slightly
when
it
passes
through
an
absorbing
medium

Who
discovered
the
speed
of
light
One
of
the
first
measurements
of
the
speed
of
light
was
by
Ole
R
mer
in
by
observing
the
moons
of
Jupiter
The
speed
of
light
was
first
measured
to
high
precision
in
by
the
Michelson
Morley
Experiment
How
do
we
know
the
speed
of
light
Ole
R
mer
was
able
to
measure
the
speed
of
light
by
observing
eclipses
of
Jupiter
s
moon
Io
When
Jupiter
was
closer
to
Earth
R
mer
noted
that
eclipses
of
Io
occurred
slightly
earlier
than
when
Jupiter
was
farther
away
R
mer
attributed
this
effect
to
the
time
it
takes
for
light
to
travel
over
the
longer
distance
when
Jupiter
was
farther
from
the
Earth
How
did
we
learn
the
speed
of
light
Galileo
Galilei
is
credited
with
discovering
the
first
four
moons
of
Aristotle
Empedocles
Galileo
illustrated
here
Ole
R
mer
and
countless
other
philosophers
and
physicists
in
history
have
contemplated
the
speed
of
light
Image

As
early
as
the
th
century
BC
Greek
philosophers
like
Empedocles
and
Aristotle
disagreed
on
the
nature
of
light
speed
Empedocles
proposed
that
light
whatever
it
was
made
of
must
travel
and
therefore
must
have
a
rate
of
travel
Aristotle
wrote
a
rebuttal
of
Empedocles
view
in
his
own
treatise
On
Sense
and
the
Sensible
arguing
that
light
unlike
sound
and
smell
must
be
instantaneous
Aristotle
was
wrong
of
course
but
it
would
take
hundreds
of
years
for
anyone
to
prove
it
lantern
One
uncovered
his
lantern
when
the
other
person
saw
the
flash
he
uncovered
his
too
But
Galileo
s
experimental
distance
wasn
t
far
enough
for
his
participants
to
record
the
speed
of
light
He
could
only
conclude
that
light
traveled
at
least
times
faster
than
sound
In
the
s
Danish
astronomer
Ole
R
mer
tried
to
create
a
reliable
timetable
for
sailors
at
sea
and
according
to
NASA
accidentally
came
up
with
a
new
best
estimate
for
the
speed
of
light
To
create
an
astronomical
clock
he
recorded
the
precise
timing
of
the
eclipses
of
Jupiter
s
moon
Io
from
Earth
Over
time
R
mer
observed
that
Io
s
approaching
and
occurred
on
schedule
when
the
planets
were
at
their
closest
or
farthest
points
This
observation
demonstrated
what
we
today
know
as
the
Doppler
effect
the
change
in
frequency
of
light
or
sound
emitted
by
a
moving
object
that
in
the
astronomical
world
manifests
as
the
so
called
redshift
the
shift
towards
redder
longer
wavelengths
in
objects
speeding
away
from
us
In
a
leap
of
intuition
R
mer
determined
that
light
was
taking
measurable
time
to
travel
from
Io
to
Earth
R
mer
used
his
observations
to
estimate
the
speed
of
light
Since
the
size
of
the
solar
system
and
Earth
s
orbit
wasn
t
yet
accurately
known
argued
a
paper
in
the
American
Journal
of
Physics
he
was
a
bit
off
But
at
last
scientists
had
a
number
to
work
with
R
mer
s
calculation
put
the
speed
of
light
at
about
miles
per
second
km
s
In
English
physicist
James
Bradley
based
a
new
set
of
calculations
on
the
change
in
the
apparent
position
of
stars
caused
by
Earth
s
travels
around
the
sun
He
estimated
the
speed
of
light
at
miles
per
second
km
s
accurate
to
within
about
of
the
real
value
according
to
the
American
Physical
Society
Two
new
attempts
in
the
mid
s
brought
the
problem
back
to
Earth
French
physicist
Hippolyte
Fizeau
set
a
beam
of
light
on
a
rapidly
rotating
toothed
wheel
with
a
mirror
set
up
miles
km
away
to
reflect
it
back
to
its
source
Varying
the
speed
of
the
wheel
allowed
Fizeau
to
calculate
how
long
it
took
for
the
light
to
travel
out
of
the
hole
to
the
adjacent
mirror
and
back
through
the
gap
Another
French
physicist
Leon
Foucault
used
a
rotating
mirror
rather
than
a
wheel
to
perform
essentially
the
same
experiment
The
two
independent
methods
each
came
within
about
miles
per
second
km
s
of
the
speed
of
light

Another
scientist
who
tackled
the
speed
of
light
mystery
was
Poland
born
Albert
A
Michelson
who
grew
up
in
California
during
the
state
s
gold
rush
period
and
honed
his
interest
in
physics
while
attending
the
U
S
Naval
Academy
according
to
the
University
of
Virginia
In
he
attempted
to
replicate
Foucault
s
method
of
determining
the
speed
of
light
but
Michelson
increased
the
distance
between
mirrors
and
used
extremely
high
quality
mirrors
and
lenses
Michelson
s
result
of
miles
per
second
km
s
was
accepted
as
the
most
accurate
measurement
of
the
speed
of
light
for
years
until
Michelson
re
measured
it
himself
In
his
second
round
of
experiments
Michelson
flashed
lights
between
two
mountain
tops
with
carefully
measured
distances
to
get
a
more
precise
estimate
And
in
his
third
attempt
just
before
his
death
in
according
to
the
Smithsonian
s
Air
and
Space
magazine
he
built
a
mile
long
depressurized
tube
of
corrugated
steel
pipe
The
pipe
simulated
a
near
vacuum
that
would
remove
any
effect
of
air
on
light
speed
for
an
even
finer
measurement
which
in
the
end
was
just
slightly
lower
than
the
accepted
value
of
the
speed
of
light
today
Michelson
also
studied
the
nature
of
light
itself
wrote
astrophysicist
Ethan
Siegal
in
the
Forbes
science
blog
Starts
With
a
Bang
The
best
minds
in
physics
at
the
time
of
Michelson
s
experiments
were
divided
Was
light
a
wave
or
a
particle
Michelson
along
with
his
colleague
Edward
Morley
worked
under
the
assumption
that
light
moved
as
a
wave
just
like
sound
And
just
as
sound
needs
particles
to
move
Michelson
and
Morley
and
other
physicists
of
the
time
reasoned
light
must
have
some
kind
of
medium
to
move
through
This
invisible
undetectable
stuff
was
called
the
luminiferous
aether
also
known
as
ether
very
basic
version
of
the
instrument
used
today
in
LIGO
facilities
Michelson
could
not
find
evidence
of
any
kind
of
luminiferous
aether
whatsoever
Light
he
determined
can
and
does
travel
through
a
vacuum
The
experiment
and
Michelson
s
body
of
work
was
so
revolutionary

would
have

Special

and
the
speed
of

Einstein
s
theory
of
special
relativity
unified
energy
matter
and
the
speed
of
light
in
a
famous
equation
E
mc
The
equation
describes
the
relationship
between
mass
and
energy
small
amounts
of
mass
m
contain
or
are
made
up
of
an
inherently
enormous
amount
of
energy
E
That
s
what
makes
nuclear
bombs
so
powerful
They
re
converting
mass
into
blasts
of
energy
Because
energy
is
equal
to
mass
times
the
speed
of
light
squared
the
speed
of
light
serves
as
a
conversion
factor
explaining
exactly
how
much
energy
must
be
within
matter
And
because
the
speed
of
light
is
such
a
huge
number
even
small
amounts
of
mass
must
equate
to
vast
quantities
of
energy
To
accurately
describe
the
universe
Einstein
s
elegant
equation
requires
the
speed
of
light
to
be
an
immutable
constant
Einstein
asserted
that
light
moved
through
a
vacuum
not
any
kind
of
luminiferous
aether
and
in
such
a
way
that
it
moved
at
the
same
speed
no
matter
the
speed
of
the
observer
Think
of
it
like
this
Observers
sitting
on
a
train
could
look
at
a
train
moving
along
a
parallel
track
and
think
of
its
relative
movement
to
themselves
as
zero
But
observers
moving
nearly
the
speed
of
light
would
still
perceive
light
as
moving
away
from
them
at
more
than
million
mph
That
s
because
moving
really
really
fast
is
one
of
the
only
confirmed
methods
of
time
travel
time
actually
slows
down
for
observer
moving
slowly
In
other
words
Einstein
proposed
that
the
speed
of
light
doesn
t
vary
with
the
time
or
place
that
you
measure
it
or
how
fast
you
yourself
are
moving
Therefore
objects
with
mass
cannot
ever
reach
the
speed
of
light
If
an
object
ever
did
reach
the
speed
of
light
its
mass
would
become
infinite
And
as
a
result
the
energy
required
to
move
the
object
would
also
become
infinite
an
impossibility
That
means
if
we
base
our
understanding
of
physics
on
special
relativity
which
most
modern
physicists
do
the
speed
of
light
is
the
immutable
speed
limit
of
our
universe
the
fastest
that
anything
can
travel
What
goes
faster
than
the
speed
of
light
Although
the
speed
of
light
is
often
referred
to
as
the
universe
s
speed
limit
the
universe
actually
expands
even
faster
The
universe
expands
at
a
little
more
than
miles
kilometers
per
second
for
each
megaparsec
of
distance
from
the
observer
wrote
astrophysicist
Paul
Sutter
in
a
previous
article
for
Space
com
A
megaparsec
is
million
light
years
a
really
long
way
In
other
words
a
galaxy
megaparsec
away
appears
to
be
traveling
away
At
some
point
at
some
obscene
distance
the
speed
tips
over
the
scales
and
exceeds
the
speed
of
light
all
from
the
natural
regular
expansion
of
space

explained

Does

Light
in
a
vacuum
is
generally
held
to
travel
at
an
absolute
speed
but
light
traveling
through
any
material
can
be
slowed
down
The
amount
that
a
material
slows
down
light
is
called
its
refractive
index
Light
bends
when
coming
into
contact
with
particles
which
results
in
a
decrease
in
speed
For
example
light
traveling
through
Earth
s
atmosphere
moves
almost
as
fast
as
light
in
a
vacuum
slowing
down
by
just
three
ten
thousandths
of
the
speed
of
light
But
light
passing
through
a
diamond
slows
to
less
than
half
its
typical
speed
PBS
NOVA
reported
Even
so
it
travels
through
the
gem
at
over
million
mph
almost
km
s
enough
to
make
a
difference
but
still
incredibly
fast
Light
can
be
trapped
and
even
stopped
inside
ultra
cold
clouds
of
atoms
according
to
a
study
published
in
the
journal
Nature
More
recently
a
study
published
in
the
journal
Physical
Review
Letters
proposed
a
new
way
to
stop
light
in
its
tracks
at
exceptional
points
or
places
where
two
separate
light
emissions
intersect
and
merge
into
one
Researchers
have
also
tried
to
slow
down
light
even
when
it
s
traveling
through
a
vacuum
A
team
of
Scottish
scientists
successfully
slowed
down
a
single
photon
or
particle
of
light
even
as
it
moved
through
a
vacuum
as
described
in
their
study
published
in
the
journal
Science
In
their
measurements
the
difference
between
a
slowed
photon
and
a
regular
photon
was
just
a
few
millionths
of
a
meter
but
it
demonstrated
that
light
in
a
vacuum
can
be
slower
than
the
official
speed
of
light

Refraction
is
the
bending
of
the
path
of
a
light
wave
as
it
passes
across
the
boundary
separating
two
media
Refraction
is
caused
by
the
change
in
speed
experienced
by
a
wave
when
it
changes
medium
Lesson
focused
on
the
topics
of
What
causes
refraction
and
Which
direction
does
light
refract
In
that
lesson
we
learned
that
light
can
either
refract
towards
the
normal
when
slowing
down
while
crossing
the
boundary
or
away
from
the
normal
when
speeding
up
while
crossing
the
boundary
The
focus
of
Lesson
is
upon
the
question
of
By
how
much
does
light
refract
when
it
crosses
a
boundary
In
the
first
part
of
Lesson
we
learned
that
a
comparison
of
the
angle
of
refraction
to
the
angle
of
incidence
provides
a
good
measure
of
the
refractive
ability
of
any
given
boundary
The
more
that
light
refracts
the
bigger
the
difference
between
these
two
angles
In
this
part
of
Lesson
we
will
learn
about
a
mathematical
equation
relating
these
two
angles
and
exact
center
of
the
dish
The
angle
of
incidence
can
be
measured
at
the
point
of
incidence
This
ray
will
refract
bending
towards
the
normal
since
the
light
is
passing
from
a
medium
in
which
it
travels
fast
into
one
in
which
it
travels
slow
FST
Once
the
light
ray
enters
the
water
it
travels
in
a
straight
line
until
it
reaches
the
second
boundary
At
the
second
boundary
the
light
ray
is
approaching
along
the
normal
to
the
curved
surface
this
stems
from
the
geometry
of
circles
The
ray
does
not
refract
upon
exiting
since
the
angle
of
incidence
is
degrees
recall
the
If

The
ray
of

therefore
exits
at
the

angle
as
the

ray
of

made
at
the
first

These
two
angles
can
be
measured
and
recorded
The
angle
of

of
the
laser
beam
can
be
changed
to
degrees
and
new
measurements
can
be
made

This
is
not

The
same
pattern
would

for

Experimentally
it

Planck
was
studying
something
called
blackbody
radiation
or
light
from
a
special
device
that
emitted
light
at
all
frequencies
as
efficiently
as
possible
Until
Planck
nobody
could
explain
the
spectrum
of
light
coming
from
these
devices
so
Planck
added
a
fix
to
the
equations
By
assuming
that
light
could
be
emitted
only
in
discrete
chunks
of
energy
known
as
quanta
he
was
able
to
develop
a
formula
that
perfectly
explained
the
blackbody
spectra
according
to
HyperPhysics
several
years
later
Albert
Einstein
took
it
one
step
further
To
explain
the
photoelectric
effect
which
is
the
release
of
electrons
from
a
metal
when

shines
on

Einstein
proposed
that
light
itself
is
composed
of
discrete
little
chunks
according
to
the
American
Physical
Society
Over
time
those
little
chunks
became
known

Photons
have

which
allows
them
to
travel
at
the
fastest
possible
speed
in
the
universe
the
speed
of

However
they
do
have
energy
and

The
energy
of
a

is
given
by

times
the

according

The
fact
that

enables
a
broad
array
of
applications
For
example
solar
sails
are
experimental
propulsion
devices
that
use
sunlight
to
push
a
spacecraft
According
to
NASA
the
photons
from
the
sun
bounce
off
of
the
reflecting
sail
thus
imparting
their
momentum
on
the
sail
and
moving
the
spacecraft
Our
understanding
of
the
rate
of
the
passage
of
time
comes
from
Einstein
s
theory
of
special
relativity
which
states
that
objects
traveling
closer
and
closer
to
the
speed
of
light
will
experience
slower
and
slower
rates
of
the
passage
of
time
In
other
words
moving
clocks
run
slowly
according
to
John
D
Horton
of
the
University
of
However
the
mathematics
of
special
relativity
apply
only
to
objects
traveling
more
slowly
than
the
speed
of
light
and
don
t
apply
directly
to
photons
which
do
travel
at
the
speed
of
light
Thus
it
s
impossible
to
say
what
a
photon
experiences
in
terms
of
the
flow
of
time
because
scientists
have
no
mathematical
language
to
support
it

Red
shift
is
a
key
concept
for
astronomers
The
term
can
be
understood
literally
the
wavelength
of
the
light
is
stretched
so
the
light
is
seen
as
shifted
towards
the
red
part
of
the
spectrum
Something
similar
happens
to
sound
waves
when
a
source
of
sound
moves
recedes
Light
behaves
like
a
wave
so
light
from
a
luminous
object
undergoes
a
Doppler
like
shift
if
the
source
is
moving
relative
to
us
Ever
since
when
Edwin
Hubble
discovered
that
the
Universe
is
expanding
we
have
known
that
most
other
galaxies
are
moving
away
from
us
Light
from
these
galaxies
is
shifted
to
longer
and
this
means
redder
wavelengths
in
other
words
it
is
red
shifted
Since
light
travels
at
such
a
great
speed
relative
to
everyday
phenomena
a
million
times
faster
than
sound
we
do
not
experience
this
red
shift
in
our
daily
lives

light
pollution
Definition
of
light
pollution
Light
pollution
is
the
human
made
alteration
of
outdoor
light
levels
from
those
occurring
naturally
When
we
over
light
fail
to
use
timers
and
sensors
or
use
the
wrong
color
of
light
we
can
negatively
affect
many
parts
of
our
world
including
migratory
birds
pollinators
sea
turtles
and
mammals
including
humans
Light
can
be
a
pollutant
Most
of
us
are
familiar
with
air
pollution
water
pollution
and
land
pollution
but
did
you
know
that
light
can
also
be
a
pollutant
Components
of
light
pollution
include
Glare
excessive
brightness
that
causes
visual
discomfort
Sky

areas
Light
trespass
light
falling

Light
pollution
is
a
side
effect
of

What
is
a
light
year
Posted
by
February
A
light
year
is
how
astronomers
measure
distance
in
space
It
s
defined
by
how
far
a
beam
of
light
travels
in
one
year
a
distance
of
six
trillion
miles
Think
of
it
as
the
bigger
badder
cousin
of
the
inch
the
mile
the
kilometer
and
the
furlong
If
you
like
to
keep
up
with
what
s
going
on
in
astronomy
it
s
worth
spending
a
little
bit
of
time
understanding
what
the
deal
is
with
this
funny
unit
of
measurement
Astronomers
use
a
beam
of
light
as
their
reference
to
finding
distances
to
space
objects

Have
you
ever
been
on
your
way
to
meet
some
friends
and
while
en
Astronomers
do
the
same
thing
when
figuring
out
the
distance
to
a
star
or
galaxy
but
instead
of
relying
on
how
fast
they
could
drive
or
walk
they
use
a
beam
of
light
as
their
reference
Why
do
things
this
way
First
light
is
convenient
Throughout
the
universe
all
light
travels
at
exactly
the
same
speed
about
million
miles
per
hour
We
don
t
usually
think
about
light
traveling
anywhere
because
when
we
flick
on
a
light
switch
there
it
is
We
don
t
have
to
wait
for
the
room
to
light
up
It
happens
instantaneously
Except
that
it
s
not
instantaneous
just
insanely
fast
In
fact
let
s
pause
for
a
second
and
reflect
on
how
ludicrously
quick
the
speed
of
light
is
If
you
could
travel
at
the
speed
of
light
you
could
circle
the
globe
of
Earth
almost
eight
times
in
one
second

Kuring
Impressive
Certainly
faster
than
traveling
by
airplane
So
if
you
were
to
travel
off
the
Earth
in
a
straight
line
at
light
speed
you
d
get
pretty
far
in
the
same
amount
of
time
right
Actually
since
space
is
so
vast
you
wouldn
t
have
even
made
it
to
the
moon
Travel
to
the
moon
takes
about
a
second
and
a
half
at
light
speed
Travel
to
the
sun
at
light
speed
takes
about
eight
minutes
Can
you
even
imagine
Traveling
at
a
speed
where
you
cross
nearly
miles
every
second
for
eight
full
minutes
would
only
get
you
to
the
center
of
our
solar
system
A
light
beam
needs
only
minutes
to

the

The
fact
that
light
takes
time
to
get
anywhere
has
an
interesting
side
effect
If
light
from
the
sun
takes
eight
minutes
to
get
to
us
then
we
re
actually
seeing
the
sun
as
it
was
eight
minutes
ago
We
re
looking
into
the
past
have
your
ears
to
know
when
things
were
happening
Since
it
takes
some
time
for
the
sound
to
get
to
you
you
d
always
be
hearing
things
a
few
seconds
after
they
happened
The
same
happens
with
light
we
only
see
something
once
the
light
from
that
event
actually
gets
to
our
eyes
When
we
re
looking
across
a
room
the
time
delay
is
only
a
few
billionths
of
a
second
But
when
we
start
looking
across
large
enough
distances
the
light
becomes
noticeably
delayed
like
the
sounds
are
from
exploding
fireworks
The
red
star
in
the
center
of
this
picture
is
Proxima
Centauri
our
sun
s
nearest
neighbor
among
the
stars
A
beam
of
light
from
this
star
takes
about
years
to
travel
to
Earth
Image

hyperphysics
phy
astr
gsu
edu
The
main
reason
for
using
light
years
however
is
because
the
distances
we
deal
with
in
space
are
immense
If
we
stick
to
miles
or
kilometers
we
quickly
run
into
unwieldy
numbers
just
measuring
the
that
sits
a
mere
miles
away
Using
a
longer
yard
stick
so
to
speak
helps
keep
the
numbers
at
least
manageable
To
an
astronomer
the
distance
to
Proxima
Centauri
is
only
four
light
years
Put
another
way
it
takes
the
light
from
our
stellar
next
door
neighbor
four
years
to
get
to
Earth
The
Milky
Way
galaxy
in
which
our
sun
and
all
the
stars
we
see
at
night
reside
spans
light
years
from
one
end
to
the
other
Putting
that
into
perspective
the
duration
of
recorded
human
history
is
roughly
years
So
light
from
a
star
at
one
end
of
our
galaxy
takes
times
longer
than
all
of
recorded
history
to
get
to
the
other
end

Galaxy

distance

years

Moving
beyond
our
galaxy
it
s
just
over
two
million
light
years
to
our
nearest
galactic
neighbor
the
Andromeda
galaxy
The
light
we
currently
see
from
that
galaxy
left
there
about
the
same
time
the
ancestors
of
modern
humans
were
first
discovering
stone
tools
Our
last
stop
takes
us
to
the
edge
of
the
visible
universe
It
s
also
here
where
the
trickiness
of
measuring
distance
in
an
ever
expanding
universe
becomes
apparent
The
light
we
see
coming
from
the
farthest
depths
of
the
universe
has
been
traveling
across
the
cosmos
for
almost
three
times
longer
than
our
planet
has
existed
nearly
billion
years
But
there
s
a
catch
we
cannot
say
that
the
edge
of
the
visible
universe
is
billion
light
years
away

Because

A
galaxy
whose

took
billion
years
to
reach
our
little
planet
has
in

moved
even
further
away

to

beacon
if
we
stopped
the
universe
from
expanding
and
stretched
out
a
really
long
tape
measure
is
just
over
billion
light
years
Even
in
light
years
measuring
distances
across
the
universe
becomes
unwieldy
But
measuring
in
something
familiar
like
miles
is
truly
humbling

You
may
have
seen
the

fireflies
on
a
summer
s

The
fireflies
produce
light
through
a
chemical
reaction
in
their
glowing
abdomens
a
process
known
as
bioluminescence
But
did
you
know
that
seascapes
can
also
glow
and
glitter
thanks
to
the
light
producing
abilities
of
many
marine
organisms
Some
fish
dangle
a
lighted
lure
in
front
of
their
mouths
to
attract
prey
while
some
squid
shoot
out
bioluminescent
liquid
instead
of
ink
to
confuse
their
predators
Humans
primarily
see
bioluminescence
triggered
by
a
physical
disturbance
such
as
waves
or
a
moving
boat
hull
that
gets
the
animal
to
show
their
light
off
but
often
animals
light
up
in
response
to
an
attack
or
in

to
attract
a
mate
Bioluminescent

Bioluminescence
occurs
through
a
chemical
reaction
that
produces
light
energy
within
an
organism
s
body
For
a
reaction
to
occur
a
species
must
contain
luciferin
a
molecule
that
when
it
reacts
with
oxygen
produces
light
There
are
different
types
of
luciferin
which
vary
depending
on
the
animal
hosting
the
reaction
Many
organisms
also
produce
the
catalyst
luciferase
which
helps
to
speed
up
the
reaction
Animals
can
closely
control
when
they
light
up
by
regulating
their
chemistry
and
brain
processes
depending
on
their
immediate
needs
whether
a
meal
or
a
mate
Some
organisms
even
bundle
the
luciferin
with
oxygen
in
what
is
called
a
photoprotein
like
a
pre
packaged
bioluminescence
bomb
that
is
ready
to
light
up
the
moment
a
certain
ion
typically
calcium
becomes
present

can

intensity

In

there
are
about

some
cases
animals
take

other
bioluminescent

to
gain
the
ability

within
hours
of
its
birth
But
usually
the
animal
itself
contains
the
chemicals
necessary
for
the
reaction
that
produces
bioluminescence
The
number
of
species
that
bioluminesce
and
the
variations
in
the
chemical
reactions
that
produce
light
are
evidence
that
bioluminescence
has
evolved
many
times
over
at
least
separate
times
This
number
continues
to
grow
as
research
makes
new
increase
from
the
handful
of
times
that
were
known
before
Most
deep
sea
animals
produce
some
bioluminescent
light
but
the
phenomenon
isn
t
relegated
to
the
deep
one
of
the
most
common
sightings

at
the
surface
of
the

Light
travels
in
waves
of
different
shapes
known
as
wavelengths
which
determine
the
color
of
the
light
When
the
waves
hit
our
eyes
they
are
translated
into
colors
by
the
brain
depending
on
their
wavelength
The
wavelengths
that
our
eyes
can
see
are
known
as
the
visible
light
spectrum
and
we
can
see
all
the
colors
on
this
spectrum
as
they
travel
through
the
air
above
land
But
light
travels
differently
underwater
because
longer
wavelengths
can
t
travel
as
far
Most
of
the
bioluminescence
produced
in
the
ocean
is
in
the
form
of
blue
green
light
This
is
because
these
colors
are
shorter
wavelengths
of
light
which
can
travel
through
and
thus
be
seen
in
both
shallow
and
deep
water
Light
traveling
from
the
sun
of
longer
wavelengths
such
as
red
light
doesn
t
reach
the
deep
sea
This
is
why
many
deep
sea
animals
are
red
it
s
effectively
the
same
as
being
invisible
Moreover
because
it
s
not
present
many
deep
water
animals
have
lost
the
ability
to
see
it
altogether
However
some
animals
evolved
to
emit
and
see
red
light
including
the
dragonfish
Malacosteus
By
creating
their
own
red
light
in
the
deep
sea
they
are
able
to
see
red
colored
prey
as
well
as
communicate
and
even
show
prey
to
other
dragonfish
while
other
unsuspecting
animals
cannot
see
their
red
lights
as
a
warning
to
flee

Chlorophyll
the
primary
pigment
used
in

In
plants
photosynthesis
takes

Steps
of
Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis
consists
of
both

and
light
independent
reactions
In
plants
the
so
called
light
reactions
occur
within
the
chloroplast
thylakoids
where
the
aforementioned
chlorophyll
pigments
reside
When
light
energy
reaches
the
pigment
molecules
it
energizes
the
electrons
within
them
and
these
electrons
are
shunted
to
an
electron
transport
chain
in
the
thylakoid
membrane
molecules
to
produce
oxygen

boxes
can
offer
an
effective

Seasonal
affective
disorder
SAD
is
a
type
of
depression
that
typically
occurs
each
year
during
fall
and
winter
Use
of
a
light
box
can
offer
relief
But
for
some
people
light
therapy
may
be
more
effective
when
combined
with
another
SAD
treatment
such
as
an
antidepressant
or
psychotherapy
also
called
talk
therapy
Light
boxes
are
designed
to
deliver
a
therapeutic
dose
of
bright
light
to
treat
symptoms
of
SAD
There
are
many
different
types
of
light
boxes
All
light
boxes
for
SAD
treatment
are
designed
do
the
same
thing
but
one
may
work
better
for
you
than
another
It
s
best
to
talk
with
your
health
care
provider
about
choosing
and
using
a
light
box
If
you
re
experiencing
both
SAD
and
bipolar
disorder
the
advisability
and
timing
of
using
a
light
box
should
be
carefully
reviewed
with
your
health
care
provider
Increasing
exposure
too
fast
or
using
the
light
box
for
too
long
each
time
may
induce
manic
symptoms
if
you
have
bipolar
disorder
If
you
have
past
or
current
eye
problems
such
as
glaucoma
cataracts
or
eye
damage
from
diabetes
get
advice
from
your
eye
specialist
before
starting
light
therapy
Understanding
a
light
box
A
light
therapy
box
mimics
outdoor
light
It
s
thought
that
this
type
of
light
may
cause
a
chemical
change
in
the
brain
that
lifts
your
mood
and
eases
other
symptoms
of
SAD
such
as
being
tired
most
of
the
time
and
sleeping
too
much
Generally
the
light
box
should
Provide
an
exposure
to
lux
of
light
Produce
as
little
UV
light
as
possible
Typical
recommendations
include
using
the
light
box
Within
the
first
hour
of
waking
up
in
the
morning
For
about
to
minutes
About
to
inches
to
centimeters
from
your
face
but
follow
the
manufacturer
s
instructions
about
distance
With
eyes
open
but
not
looking
directly
at
the
light
Light
boxes
aren
t
regulated
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
FDA
for
SAD
treatment
so
it
s
important
to
understand
your
options
You
can
buy
a
light
box
without
a
prescription
but
it
s
best
to
use
it
under
the
guidance
of
a
health
care
provider
and
follow
the
manufacturer
s
guidelines
Your
health
care
provider
may
recommend
a
specific
light
box
Most
health
insurance
plans
don
t
cover
the
cost
What
to
consider
Here
are
some
questions
to
think
about
when
buying
a
light
box
for
seasonal
affective
disorder
Is
it
made
specifically
to
treat
SAD
If
not
it
may
not
help
your
depression
Some
light
therapy
lamps
are
designed
for
skin
disorders
not
for
SAD
Lamps
used
for
skin
disorders
mainly
produce
ultraviolet
UV
light
and
could
damage
your
eyes
if
used
incorrectly
How
bright
is
it
Light
boxes
produce
different
intensities
of
light
Brighter
boxes
will
require
less
time
to
use
each
day
compared
with
dimmer
boxes
to
achieve
the
same
effect
Usually
the
recommended
intensity
of
light
is
lux
How
much
UV
light
does
it
release
Light
boxes
for
SAD
should
be
designed
to
filter
out
most
or
all
UV
light
Contact
the
manufacturer
for
safety
information
if
you
have
questions
Can
it
cause
eye
damage
Some
light
boxes
include
features
designed
to
protect
the
eyes
Make
sure
the
light
box
filters
out
most
or
all
UV
light
to
avoid
damaging
your
eyes
Ask
your
eye
specialist
for
advice
on
choosing
a
light
box
if
you
have
eye
problems
such
as
glaucoma
cataracts
or
eye
damage
from
diabetes
Is
it
the
style
you
need
Light
boxes
come
in
different
shapes
and
sizes
with
varied
features
Some
look
like
upright
lamps
while
others
are
small
and
rectangular
Smaller
light
boxes
are
more
portable
and
easier
to
pack
if
you
re
traveling
during
fall
and
winter
The
effectiveness
of
a
light
box
depends
on
daily
use
so
buy
one
that
s
convenient
for
you
Can
you
put
it
in
the
right
location
Think
about
where
you
ll
want
to
place
your
light
box
and
what
you
might
do
during
its
use
such
as
reading
doing
a
craft
or
watching
TV
Check
the
manufacturer
s
instructions
so
you
receive
the
right
amount
of
light
at
the
proper
distance
Talk
to
your
health
care
provider
about
light
box
options
and
recommendations
so
you
get
one
that
s
best
suited
to
your

Takeaways
Blue
light
is
a
wavelength
of
light
often
emitted
by
electronic
devices
and
artificial
lights
During
the
day
blue
light
influences
your
circadian
rhythm
affecting
alertness
and
heart
rate
Limiting
blue
light
at
night
can
help
mitigate
its
effects
on
sleep
The
screens
of
electronic
devices
such
as
smartphones
computers
tablets
and
televisions
can
emit
blue
light
that
disrupts
our
natural
sleep
cycles
Research
shows
that
a
majority
of
Americans
use
electronic
devices
within
an
hour
of
going
to
bed
which
can
lead
to
unsatisfactory
sleep
Decreasing
exposure
to
light
in
the
evening
and
blue
light
in
particular
is
an
important
way
to

to
hear
a
lecture
by
the
physicist
Kristian
Birkeland
who
believed
that
he
had
unlocked
the
secrets
of
the
aurora
borealis
also
known
as
the
northern
lights
Birkeland
planned
to
demonstrate
his
theory
with
the
aid
of
a
specially
constructed
device
a
brass
plated
magnetic
sphere
called
a
terrella
suspended
inside
a
vacuum
chamber
heated
it
would
shoot
cathode
rays
across
the
chamber
toward
the
sphere
If
all
went
well
the
rays
would
interact
with
the
sphere
s
magnetic
field
producing
eerie
flashes
of
light
that
replicated
in
miniature
the
aurora
borealis
hopelessly
inadequate
grasp
of
theoretical
physics
He
died
in
and
it
wasn
t
until
the
nineteen
sixties
that
satellite
data
proved
his
hypothesis
to
be
correct
The
lights
are
caused
by
high
velocity
solar
particles
the
solar
wind
as
it
came
to
be
called
interacting
with
the
Earth
s
magnetic
field
and
atmosphere
Birkeland
remains
underappreciated
but
his
imprint
can
be
felt
in
the
mixture
of
engineering
wizardry
and
primal
enchantment
that
is
fuelling
a
touristic
boom
in
countries
where
the
northern
lights
appear
As
I
discovered
on
a
trip
to
the
Arctic
in
February
the
glow
of
an
aurora
is
sometimes
difficult
to
perceive
with
the
naked
eye
and
travellers
often
must
engage
in
a
form
of
technologically
enhanced
rapture
The
best
chances
of
seeing
the
lights
are
in
the
elliptical
area
known
as
the
Auroral
Oval
which
is
centered
on
geomagnetic
north
The
Earth
s
magnetic
field
becomes
almost
perpendicular
to
its
surface
the
much
Instagrammed
original
in
Kakslauttanen
having
fewer
igloos
and
no
Santa
s
Home
on
the
compound
I
arrived
late
exhausted
from
the
knock
on
effects
of
a
cancelled
flight
The
hotel
s
twenty
eight
Aurora
Cabins
set
around
a
large
reindeer
paddock
looked
like
quaint
log
huts
from
the
front
with
twenty
inches
of
moonlit
snow
on
the
eaves
and
a
complimentary
drinks
tray
arranged
below
like
the
furnishings
of
a
tastefully
debauched
starship
Slipping
under
a
reindeer
fur
coverlet
I
found
myself
facing
the
first
conundrum
of
northern
lights
tourism
which
is
that
the
more
comfortable
your
viewing
situation
the
more
likely
you
are
to
be
insensate
when
the
lights
appear
I
was
eager
to
see
them
naturally
but
not
obsessed
I
had
a
whole
week
and
from
what
I
d
read
at
the
time
of
my
visit
there
were
good
odds
for
a
You
can
be
woken
in
the
middle
of
the
night
if
you
wish
and
there
are
apps
that
will
rouse
you
at
the
right
moment
but
you
can
t
do
anything
about
cloudy
skies
or
daylight
The
phenomenon
that
produces
the
lights
can
occur
at
any
hour
For
the
tourist
the
question
arises
what
do
you
do
when
there
s
no
prospect
of
seeing
the
lights
which
is
much
of
the
time
The
answer
is
activities
although
safari
is
the
perversely
tropical
term
of
choice
you
can
go
on
a
reindeer
safari
a
me
was
a
German
couple
who
seemed
serious
about
the
fishing
and
a
Malaysian
family
with
a
young
daughter
who
d
come
to
Finland
because
the
lights
were
on
their
bucket
list
a
term
that
has
gone
global
Montes
showed
us
how
to
drill
holes
with
an
auger
and
baited
our
hooks
with
plastic
worms
He
d
planned
to
use
real
ones
but
they
had
frozen
to
take
photographs
I
asked
Montes
what
role
social
media
had
played
in
northern
lights
tourism
and
he
gave
an
exasperated
laugh
The
Ivalo
hotel
was
constantly
being
approached
by
YouTubers
and
Instagram
influencers
who
and
natural
phenomena
The
image
of
those
igloos
was
suddenly
everywhere
Montes
said
We
were
nearing
the
low
point
in
the
solar
cycle
now
he
noted
though
he
assured
me
that
the
lights
could
still
be
thrilling
adding
You
just
have
to
be
lucky
Oxygen
emits
a
greenish
hue
and
occasionally
red
nitrogen
emits
violet
and
blue
In
this
case
the
green
turned
out
to
be
emitted
by
a
light
on
the
thermostat
its
glow
was
reflected
in
the
glass
dome
Nevertheless
the
sky
had
cleared
and
the
stars
glittered
promisingly
above
the
snow
gloved
spruce
trees
I
stared
up
for
a
while
Gazing
at
the
sky
at
a
m
however
in
the
hope
of
being
granted
a
vision
of
dancing
emerald
lights
is
an
activity
that
quickly
starts
to
feel
absurd
even
delusional
and
I
soon
passed
out
again
In
the
morning
I
learned
that
I
hadn
t
missed
anything
I
went
a
bit
farther
north
to
the
vast
frozen
lake
of
Inari
where
the
lack
of
light
pollution
supposedly
raises
the
chances
of
seeing
the
lights
Here
as
everywhere
my
hotel
was
packed
tour
buses
and
S
U
V
s
lined
the
parking
lot
Guests
in
puffer
jackets
were
riding
fatbikes
on
the
ice
Inside
at
the
buffet
they
piled
plates
with
tones
of
Home
Counties
English
Those
came
from
a
British
couple
recent
retirees
from
Surrey
who
were
checking
things
off
their
bucket
list
A
safari
in
Zambia
would
follow
the
northern
lights
They
d
been
in
Inari
for
four
nights
and
had
seen
a
faint
glow
one
evening
after
being
roused
by
the
hotel
s
Aurora
Alert
It
hadn
t
impressed
them
indicating
higher
chances
of
seeing
an
aurora
A
smudge
of
light
appeared
to
the
west
and
we
looked
at
our
guide
hopefully
but
he
shook
his
head
it
was
just
snowmobile
headlights
reflected
by
clouds
Someone
asked
him
what
it
felt
like
to
see
a
truly
powerful
display
and
he
replied
that
it
was
a
spiritual
experience
get
this
flow
of
emotion
It
seemed
like
a
good
answer
It
certainly
accounted
for
a
vague
feeling
I
d
had
in
my
glass
igloo
which
was
that
even
if
I
did
see
the
lights
there
d
be
something
sad
and
incomplete
about
not
having
anyone
with
me
to
share
the
experience
I
d
been
with
an
old
friend
when
I
helicoptered
into
the
Grand
Canyon

impossible
not
to
read
judgment
in
its
blank
expression
Nordic
folklore
tends
to
view
the
northern
lights
as
a
not
entirely
benign
phenomenon
S
mi
mythology
in
particular
invests
them
with
highly
equivocal
powers
They
can
predict
the
weather
but
they
can
so
at
your
peril
As
I
stood
on
the
airport
curb
wondering
what
to
do
it
struck
me
that
the
aurora
industry
was
a
kind
of
elaborate
whistling
for
the
lights
with
all
the
folly
and
hubris
that
this
entailed
It
sold
itself
as
a
romance
with
nature
at
its
most
magical
but
it
was
premised
on
a
comprehensive
battle
against
nature
Its
imagery
of
cozy
a
call
on
my
behalf
and
after
a
long
twenty
minutes
an
airport
worker
appeared
and
opened
the
doors
He
laughed
at
my
story
telling
me
that
I
d
arrived
far
too
early
for
my
afternoon
flight
Two
hours
later
just
before
takeoff
other
passengers
began
strolling
in
blas
locals
in
T
shirts
and
sneakers
dioramas
of
trapped
foxes
and
hunters
clubbing
baby
seals
I
took
a
dogsled
safari
and
guided
Siberian
huskies
on
a
wobbly
but
exhilarating
ten
mile
dash
by
moonlight
across
stunning
upland
fells
In
every
one
of
Troms
s
hotel
lobbies
screens
glowed
with
images
of
the
lights
I
d
been
advised
to
try
looking
for
them
from
the
water
and
went
out
we
soon
gave
up
craning
our
necks
and
chatted
about
the
aurora
craze
instead
Everyone
seems
to
have
a
different
origin
story
The
skipper
attributed
the
boom
to
a
BBC
show
on
the
lights
featuring
Joanna
Lumley
As
he
put
it
There
was
before
Joanna
Lumley
and
there
was
after
green
I
met
with
Skogli
in
Troms
He
is
a
slight
unassuming
man
in
his
fifties
with
an
impish
way
of
deflecting
questions
about
his
post
Lumley
celebrity
clients
Brian
May
of
Queen
is
among
them
Skogli
grew
up
in
a
small
village
where
elders
spoke
the
S
mi
language
and
children
hid
from
the
lights
fearing
cosmic
abduction
An
evening
outing
with
a
photographer
friend
in
the
fall
of
coincided
with
a
series
of
unusually
intense
solar
storms
and
the
spectacle
awakened
Skogli
to
the
lights
glory
Mostly
you
just
see
green
he
told
me
But
you
saw
all
the
other
colors
that
night
The
snow
was
colored
red
He
was
also
awakened
to
the
lights
commercial
potential
The
northern
lights
wasn
t
a
product
at
that
time
he
recalled
But
they
re
one
of
the
purest
wonders
of
the
world
Moreover
the
lights
have
the
advantage
of
not
being
affected
by
global
warming
As
Skogli
put
it
We
can
t
do
anything
to
spoil
them
He
set
up
a
photography
tour
company
that
pioneered
the
idea
of
the
Aurora
Chase
you
re
driven
around
for
six
or
more
hours
in
pursuit
of
favorable
conditions
for
viewing
the
lights
Every
fjord
and
fell
has
its
own
microclimate
and
so
in
theory
there
s
always
a
chance
of
finding
clear
skies
somewhere
After
the
Lumley
film
aired
Skogli
We
discussed
why
the
aurora
often
looks
so
much
better
in
photographs
He
explained
that
a
camera
on
a
tripod
set
for
a
five
second
exposure
takes
in
far
more
light
than
the
human
eye
does
when
it
looks
at
something
and
consequently
it
produces
a
more
vivid
image
A
camera
can
turn
even
relatively
weak
displays
into
dramatic
pictures
and
these
discussion
on
the
subject
within
the
tourism
industry
without
success
In
a
rare
departure
from
diplomatic
geniality
he
dismissed
most
Instagram
photos
of
the
lights
as
junk
digitally
colorized
files
to
produce
likes
primitive
than
my
other
accommodations
I
d
signed
up
for
a
night
with
a
Finnish
company
that
takes
you
out
to
a
wilderness
camp
and
leaves
you
alone
until
morning
That
night
had
come
around
and
I
was
slightly
regretting
my
plan
I
had
no
idea
what
to
expect
but
various
scenarios
had
begun
filling
the
void
mostly
turning
on
the
idea
of
abandonment
wind
had
also
risen
driving
thick
clouds
straight
toward
it
A
tense
couple
of
minutes
followed
in
which
we
seemed
to
be
watching
an
elemental
standoff
between
darkness
and
light
For
a
few
moments
the
green
bar
was
surrounded
by
tinges
of
violet
the
effect
of
atmospheric
nitrogen
complementing
that
of
the
green
glowing
oxygen
But
the
clouds
I
could
now
say
truthfully
that
I
d
seen
the
northern
lights
and
I
was
happy
though
my
happiness
had
more
to
do
with
relief
mission
accomplished
than
with
joy
It
had
been
a
very
minor
spillage
of
the
documentary
status
of
such
images
Do
they
memorialize
my
evening
or
the
camera
s
The
question
goes
to
the
heart
of
what
I
was
beginning
to
think
of
as
the
second
conundrum
of

seemingly
inextricable

into

display
When
an
industry
is
focussed
so
determinedly
on
the
commodity
of
wonderment
it
spurs
thoughts
of
resistance
at
least
it
does
in
me
Moreover
my
knowledge
that
the
lights
were
merely
an
effect

an

contracted
into

chattered
excitedly
I
was
about

away
when
a

shot
out

and
zoomed
over
our

corkscrewing
across

almost
toppled
over

How
LEDs
are
Different
LED
lighting
is
very
different
from
other
lighting
types
such
as
incandescent
and
CFL
Key
differences
include
Light
Source
LEDs
are
the
size
of
a
fleck
of
pepper
and
can
emit
light
in
a
range
of
colors
A
mix
of
red
green
and
blue
LEDs
is
sometimes
used
to
make
white
light
Direction
LEDs
emit
light
in
a
specific
direction
reducing
the
need
for
reflectors
and
diffusers
that
can
trap
light
This
feature
makes
LEDs
more
efficient
for
many
uses
such
as
recessed
downlights
and
task
lighting
With
other
types
of
lighting
the
light
must
be
reflected
to
the
desired
direction
and
more
than
half
of
the
light
may
never
leave
the
fixture
Heat
LEDs
emit
very
little
heat
In
comparison
incandescent
bulbs
release
of
their
energy
as
heat
and
CFLs
release
about
of
their
energy
as
heat
Lifetime
LED
lighting
products
typically
last
much
longer
than
other
lighting
types

Emerging
from
this
backdrop
is
LiFi
a
transformative
alternative
poised
to
reshape
our
wireless
communication
experiences
By
harnessing
the
vast
bandwidth
of
the
light
spectrum
LiFi
promises
speeds
that
can
eclipse
conventional
Wi
Fi
by
up
to
times
But
it
s
not
just
about
speed
With
LiFi
connecting
to
the
internet
could
be
as
straightforward
as
turning
on
a
light
Utilizing
LED
based
light
to
convey
data
this
technological
shift
guarantees
rapid
data
transfer
while
also
excelling
in
environments
where

Decoding
the
Mechanics
of
LiFi
At
its
essence
LiFi
operates
as
a
Visible
Light
Communications
VLC
system
promising
unparalleled
wireless
internet
speeds
Central
to
this
system
are
LED
light
bulbs
These
bulbs
emit
swift
light
pulses
imperceptible
to
the
human
eye
laden
with
information
It
s
akin
to
an
advanced
hyper
speed
Morse
code
Devices
fitted
with
the
requisite
LiFi
s
Inherent
Security
Edge
The
modus
operandi
of
LiFi
using
light
for
data
transfer
furnishes
it
with
intrinsic
security
advantages
A
standout
feature
is
the
confinement
of
light
bound
data
within
its
immediate
environment
courtesy
of
light
s
inability
to
traverse
walls
This
characteristic
ensures
that
data
interception
by
unauthorized
entities
outside
the
designated
space
becomes
a
near
impossibility
adding
a
robust
layer
of
LiFi
s
underpinning
is
both
innovative
and
straightforward
The
technology
relies
on
a
modulated
light
frequency
emitted
by
LED
light
sources
When
data
needs
to
be
transmitted
the
LED
s
brightness
oscillates
at
ultra
high
speeds
too
rapid
for
the
human
eye
to
perceive
These
oscillations
or
flickers
represent
binary
codes
of
s
and
s
essentially
the
language
of
computers
On
the
receiving
end
a
photosensitive
detector
captures
these
light
signals
The
detector
then
demodulates
the
light
fluctuations
back
into
electronic
data
Given
the
sheer
speed
of
these
oscillations
vast
amounts
of
data
can
be
transferred
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
Accompanying
an

at
the

the

is
its

The

are

than

The
difference
between
ordinary

and
laser
light
is
like
the
difference
between
ripples
in
your
bathtub
and
huge

You
ve

noticed
that
if

A
laser
does
something
similar
with

It
starts
off
with
weak
light
and
keeps
adding
more
and

become
ever
more

If
you
ve
even
seen
a
laser
in
a
science
lab
you
ll
have
noticed
two
very
important
differences
straightaway
Where
a
flashlight
produces
white
light
a
mixture
of
all
different
colors
made
by
light
waves
of
all
different
frequencies
a
laser
makes
what
s
called
monochromatic
light
of
a
single
very
precise
frequency
and
color
often
bright
red
or
green
or
an
invisible
color
such
as
infrared
or
ultraviolet
Where
a
flashlight
beam
spreads
out
through
a
lens
into
a
short
and
fairly
fuzzy
cone
a
laser
shoots
a
much
tighter
narrower
beam
over
a
much
longer
distance
we
say
it
s
highly
collimated
There
s
a
third
important
difference
you
won
t
have
noticed
Where
the
light
waves
in
a
flashlight
beam
are
all
jumbled
up
with
the
crests
of
some
beams
mixed
with
the
troughs
of
others
the
waves
in
laser
light
are
exactly
in
step
the
crest
of
every
wave
is
lined
up
with
the
crest
of
every
other
wave
We
say
laser
light
is
coherent
Think
of
a
flashlight
beam
as
a
crowd
of
commuters
pushing
and
shoving
jostling
their
way
down
the
platform
of
a
railroad
station
by

a
laser
beam
is
like
a
parade
of
Before
you
can
understand
how
a
laser
works
you
need
to
know
how
an
atom
can
give
off
light
If
you
re
not
sure
how
this
happens
take
a
look
at
the
box
how
atoms
make
light
in
our
introductory
article
about
light
A
laser
is
effectively
a
machine
that
makes
billions
of
atoms
pump
out
trillions
of
photons
light
particles
all
at
once
so
they
line
up
to
form
a
really
concentrated
light
beam
What
do
you
need
to
make
a
laser
medium
shown
in
the
artwork
below
as
a
red
bar
with
a
flash
tube
yellow
zig
zag
lines
wrapped
around
it
The
flash
tube
looks
a
bit
like
a
fluorescent
strip
light
only
it
s
coiled
around
the
ruby
crystal
and
it
flashes
every
so
often
like
a
camera
s
flash
lamp
electrons
jump
to
a
higher
energy
level
After
a
few
milliseconds
the
electrons
return
to
their
original
energy
level
ground
state
by
giving
off
a
photon
of
light
small
blue
blobs
This
is
called
spontaneous
emission
The
photons
that
atoms
give
off
zoom
up
and
down
inside
the
ruby
crystal
traveling
at
the
speed
of
light
Every
so
often
one
of
these
photons
stimulates
an
already
excited
atom
When
this
happens
the
excited
atom
gives
off
a
photon
and
we
get
our
original
photon
back
as
well
This
is
called
stimulated
emission
Now
one
photon
of
light
has
produced
two
so
the
light
has
been
amplified
increased
in
strength
In
other
words
light
amplification
an
increase
in
the
amount
of
light
has
been
caused
by
stimulated
emission
of
radiation
hence
the
name
laser
because
that
s
exactly
how
a
laser
works
back
into
the
crystal
but
lets
some
escape
The
escaping
photons
form

you

a
little
bit
more

that

of
Radiation
That
s
a
complex
and
confusing
mouthful
but
if
you
pull
it
apart
slowly
it
s
actually
a
very
clear

of

Lasers

rays
and

Although
it
s
still

by
atoms
they
make
emit
it
in
a
totally
different
way
when
electrons
jump
up
and
down
inside
them
We
can
think
of
electrons
in
atom
s
excited
but
it
s
also
unstable
It
very
quickly
returns
to
the
ground
state
by
giving
off
the
energy
it
absorbed
as
a
photon
a
particle
of
light
We
call
this
process
spontaneous
emission
of
radiation
the
atom
is
giving
off
light
emitting
radiation
all
by
itself
spontaneously

Spontaneous
emission
by
candlelight
From
candles
to
light
bulbs
and
fireflies
to
flashlights
all
conventional
forms
of
light
work
through
the
process
of
spontaneous
emission
In
a
candle
combustion
the
chemical
reaction
between
oxygen
and
fuel
in
this
case
wax
excites
atoms
and
makes
them
unstable
They
give
off
light
when
they
return
to
their
original
ground
states
Every
photon
produced
by
spontaneous
emission
inside
this
candle
flame
is
different
from
every
other
photon
which
is
why
there
s
a
mixture
of
different
wavelengths
and
colors
making
white
light
The
photons
emerge
in
random
directions
with
waves
that
are
out
of
step
with
one
another
out
of
phase
which
is
why
candlelight
is
much
weaker
than

Stimulated

a

of

would
have
more
electrons

which
is
one
reason
why
atoms
don
t
spontaneously
give
off
light
But
what
if
we
excited
those
atoms
pumped
them
full
of
energy
so
their
electrons
were
in
excited
states
In
that
case
the
population
of
excited
electrons
would
be
bigger
than
the
population
in
their
ground
states
so
there
would
be
plenty
of
electrons
ready
and
willing
to
make
photons
of
light
We
call
this
situation
a
population
inversion
because
the
usual
state
of
affairs
in
the
atoms
is
swapped
around
inverted
get
radiation
out
of
them
this
process
is
called
stimulated
emission
We
get
two
photons
out
after
putting
one
photon
in
effectively
doubling
our
light
and
amplifying
it
increasing
it
These
two
photons
can
stimulate
other
atoms
to
give
off
more
photons
so
pretty
soon
we
get
a
cascade
of
photons
a
chain
reaction
throwing
out
a
brilliant
beam
of
pure
coherent
laser
light
What
we
ve
done
here
is
amplify
light
using
stimulated
emission
of
radiation
and
that
s
how
a
laser
gets
its
name
out
a
quantum
packet
of
energy
as
a

Right
Stimulated

Fire
a

near
a

of

and
you
can

One
photon
of
light
triggers
many
so
what
we
ve
got
here
is
light
amplification
making
more
light
by
stimulated
emission
of
electromagnetic
radiation
LASER
What
makes
laser
light
so
different
If
that
s
how
lasers
make
light
why
do
they
make
a
single
color
and
a
coherent
beam
It
boils
down
to
the
idea
that
energy
can
only
exist
in
fixed
packets
each
of
which
is
called
a
quantum
It
s
a
bit
like
two
energy
levels
When
electrons
flip
back
down
from
their
excited
to
their
ground
state
they
give
out
the
same
precise
amount
of
energy
which
takes
the
form
of
a
photon
of
light
of
a
particular
color
Stimulated
emission
in
lasers
makes
electrons
produce
a
cascade
of
identical
photons
identical
in
energy
frequency
wavelength
and
that
s
why
laser
light
is
monochromatic
The
photons
produced
are
equivalent
to
waves
of
light
whose
crests
and
troughs
line
up
in
other
words
they
are
in
phase
and
that
s
what
makes
laser
light
coherent
Sponsored
links
be
doped
a
process
that
replaces
some
of
the
solid
s
atoms
with
ions
of
impurities
giving
it
just
the
right
energy
levels
to
produce
laser
light
of
a
certain
precise
frequency
Ruby
red
laser
and

by
something
like

big
advantage
is
that
they
can
be
used
to
produce
a
broader
band
of
light
frequencies
than
solid
state
and
gas
lasers
and
they
can
even
be
tuned
to
produce

We
can
trace
the
birth
of
lasers
right
back
to
the
first
two
decades
of
the
th
century
That
s
when
Albert
Einstein
figured
out
the
quantum
theory
of
light
and
photons
in
and
the
mechanism
of
stimulated
emission
in
the
two
key
components
of
laser
science
But
it
was
another
four
decades
before
the
first
practical
laser
actually
Lasers
evolved
from
masers
which
are
similar
but
produce
microwaves
and
radio
waves
instead
of
visible
light
Masers
were
invented
in
the
s
by
Charles
Townes
and
Arthur
Schawlow
both
of
whom
went
on
to
win
the
Nobel
Prize
in
Physics
for
their

Gordon

sketched
in

an
idea
for
how
a
visible
light
version
of
the
maser
could
work
coining
the
word
laser
that
we
ve
used
ever
since
Unfortunately

didn

patent
his
idea
at
the
time

History
of
traffic
lights
In
December
the
first
traffic
signals
showing
a
red
or
green
light
at
night
were
installed
outside
the
Houses
of
Parliament
in
London
A
police
constable
raised
or
lowered
the
semaphore
arms
and
at
night
operated
a
lever
to
control
the
lights
which
drivers
and
pedestrians
saw
This
system
exploded
on
January
and
was
taken
down
This
early
traffic
signal
led
to
other
parts
of
the
world
to
direct
traffic
In
the
first
electric
traffic
light
was
developed
by
Lester
Wire
a
policeman
in
Salt
Lake
City
Utah
In
August
it
was
installed
by
the
American
Traffic
Signal
Company
on
the
corner
of
East
th
Street
and
Euclid
Avenue
in
Cleveland
Ohio
In
the
first
four
way
three
colour
traffic
light
was
created
by
William
Potts
in
Detroit
Michigan
His
design
was
the
first
to
include
an
amber
caution
light
along
with
red
and
green
lights
Potts
was
Superintendent
of
Signals
for
the
Police
Department
of
Detroit
In
he
installed
automatic
four

three
colour
traffic
lights
in
towers
across
Detroit

city
In
Garrett
Morgan
patented
a
design
of
a
manually
operated
three
way
traffic
light
with
moving
arms
The
control
of
traffic
lights
changed
with
the
rise
of
computers
in
America
in

One
of
the

In
some
jurisdictions
such
as
Australia
pedestrian
lights
are
associated
with
a
sound
device
for
the
benefit
of
blind
and
visually

pedestrians
These
make
a
slow

sound
when
the
pedestrian
lights
are
red
and
a
continuous

or
fast

sound
when
the
lights
are

In
the
Australian

of

the

is
produced
in

When

In
Japan
a
traffic
light
emits
an
electronic
sound
that
mimics
the
sound
of

Some

Conventional
traffic
signal
lighting
still
common
in
some
areas
uses
a
standard
light
bulb
The
light
then
bounces
off
a
mirrored
glass
or
polished
aluminium
reflector
bowl
and
out
through
a
polycarbonate
plastic
or
glass
signal
lens
In
some
signals
these
lenses
were
cut
to
include
a
specific
refracting
pattern
Traditionally
incandescent
and
halogen
bulbs
were
used
Because
of
the
low
efficiency
of
light
output
and
a
single
point
of
failure
filament
burnout
some
traffic
authorities
are
choosing
to
retrofit
traffic
signals
with
LED
arrays
that
consume
less
power
have
increased
light
output
and

In
the
event
of
an
individual
LED
failure
the
aspect
will
still
operate
albeit
with
a
reduced
light

The
light
pattern
of
an
LED
array
can
be
comparable
to
the
pattern
of
an
incandescent
or
halogen
bulb
fitted
with
a
prismatic
lens
The
low
energy
consumption
of
LED
lights
can
pose
a
driving
risk
in
some
areas
during

incandescent
and

In
the
United
States
traffic
lights
are
currently
designed
with
lights
approximately
inches
mm
in
diameter
Previously
the
standard
had
been
inches
mm
however
those
are
slowly
being
phased
out
in
favour
of
the
larger
and
more
visible
inch
lights
Variations
used
have
also
included
a
hybrid
design
which
had
one
or
more
inch
lights
along
with
one
or
more
lights
of
inches
mm
on
the
same
light
In
the
United
Kingdom
inch
lights
were
implemented
only
with
Mellor

Signal
heads
designed
by
David
Mellor
These
were
designed
for
symbolic
optics
to
compensate
for
the

loss
caused
by
the
symbol
Following
a
study
sponsored
by
the
UK
Highways
Agency
and
completed
by
Aston
University
Birmingham
UK
an
enhanced
optical
design
was
introduced
in
the
mid
s
Criticism
by

due
to

falling

phantom
signal
appearing
to
be
illuminated
even
when
not
due
to
sunlight
reflecting
from
the
parabolic
mirror
at
low
sun
angles
led
to
the
design
of
a
signal
that
used
lenslets
to
focus
light
from
a
traditional
incandescent
bulb
through
apertures
in
a
matt
black
front
mask
This
cured
both
problems
in
an
easily

aspects
these

are
still
the

With

Aston
lenses
lights
of
inches
mm
could
be
designed
to
give
the

so
a
larger
surface
area
was
unnecessary
Consequently
lights
of
inches
mm
are
no
longer
approved
for

concerns
A
number
remain
signals
are
normally
located
farside
though
in
some
states
nearside
signals
are
also
used
Nearside
signals
can
be
beneficial
to
road
safety
as
drivers
have
more
time
to
see
a
red
light
and
are
less
likely
to
encroach
on
pedestrian
crossings
Drivers
spend
on
average
around
of
journey
time
passing
through
signalised
junctions
Traffic
lights
can
increase
the
traffic
capacity
at
intersections
and
reduce
delay
for
side
road
traffic
but
can
also
result
in
increased
delay
for
main
road
traffic
Hans
Monderman
the
innovative
Dutch
traffic
engineer
and
pioneer
of
shared
space
schemes
was
sceptical
of
their
role
and
is
quoted
as
having
said
of
them
We
only
want
traffic
lights
where
they
are
useful
and
I
haven
t
found
anywhere
where
they
are
useful
yet
A
World
Economic
Forum
study
found
that
signalised
junctions
are
linked
to
higher
rates
of
localised
air
pollution
Drivers
accelerate
and
stop
frequently
at
lights
and
as
such
peak
particle
concentration
can
be
around
times
higher
than
during
free
flow
conditions
The
WEF
recommends
that
traffic
authorities
synchronise
traffic
signals
consider
alternative
traffic
management
systems
and
consider
placing
traffic
lights
away
from
residential
areas
schools
and
hospitals

The

of

light
and
the
meanings
of
the
three
primary
colours
used
in
traffic
lights
are
frequently
found
in
many
other
contexts
Since
they
are
often
used
as
single
spots
of
colour
without

Another
type
of
traffic
light
that
is
used
in
racing
is
the
Christmas
Tree
which
is
used
in
drag
racing
The
Christmas
Tree
has
six
lights
a

three
amber
lights
a
green
light
and
a
red

The
blue
staging
light
is
divided
into
two
parts
Pre
stage
and
stage
Sometimes
there
are
two
sets
of
bulbs
on
top
of
each
other
to
represent
them
Once
a
driver
is
staged
at
the
starting
line
then
the
starter
will
activate
the
light
to
commence
racing
which
can
be
done
in
two
ways
If
a
Pro

is
used
then
the
three
amber
lights
will
flash
at
the

tree
the
amber
light
will
flash
from
top
to
bottom
When
the
green
light
comes
up
the
race
officially
begins
but
if
a

crosses
the
line
before
that
happens
then
a

Note
The
origin
of

is
from
the
English
translation
of
the
play
R
U
R
by
Karel
apek
which
debuted
in
England
in
and
introduced
the
term
robot
to
an
English
audience
For
a
short
time
in
England
it
was
fashionable
to
use
robot
for
traffic
light
from
the
late
s
when
traffic
lights
were
being
installed
in
England
This
usage
travelled
to
South
Africa
in
the
early
s
when
they
had
their
first
traffic
lights
installed
and
where
it
continues
to
be
used
almost
years
later
while
robot
for
traffic

fell
out
of
usage

When
designing
and
lighting
a
space
is
the
goal
to
fulfill
a
specific
requirement
or
to
be
creative
Both
perspectives
hold
merit
however
a
unifying
principle
should
always
prevail
people
must
remain
at
the
performance
even
in
challenging
contexts
such
as
outer
space
While
this
standpoint
has
encompassed
anthropometric
and

Among
its
most
remarkable
elements
is
the
central
oculus
an
meter
wide
opening
at
the
top
of
the
dome
that
allows
natural

This
creates
a
dynamic

that
shifts
throughout

enhancing
the
grandeur
of

Beyond
its
practical

the
oculus
establishes
a
symbolic
connection
between

and
the

with

what

color
From
a
technical

it
is
a
visual
perception
that
arises
from
the
interaction
of

with
our

However
when

Gaslighting
Reviewed
by
Psychology
Today
Staff
Gaslighting
is
an
insidious
form
of
manipulation
and
psychological
control
Victims
of
gaslighting
are
deliberately
and
systematically
fed
false
information
that
leads
them
to
question
what
they
know
to
be
true
often
about
themselves
They
may
end
up
doubting
their
memory
their
perception
and
even
their
sanity
Over
time
a
gaslighter
s
manipulations
can
grow
more
complex
and
potent
making
it
increasingly
difficult
for
the
victim
to
see
the
truth

The
term
gaslighting
comes
from
a
play
Gas
Light
and
its
film
adaptation
Gaslighting
can
occur
in
personal
or
professional
relationships
and
victims
are
targeted
at
the
core
of
their
being
their
sense
of
identity
and
self
worth
Manipulative
people
who
engage
in
gaslighting
do
so
to
attain
power
over
their
victims
either
because
they
simply
derive
warped
enjoyment
from
the
act
or
because
they
wish
to
emotionally
physically
or
financially
control
their
victim
How
does
gaslighting
begin
BUTTON
Created
with
Sketch
A
relationship
with
a
gaslighter
may
seem
to
start
out
quite
well
They
may
praise
their
target
on
a
first
date
and
immediately
confide
in
them
Such
disclosure
before
any
intimacy
has
been
established
The
more
quickly
a
victim
becomes
enamored
the
more
quickly
the
next
phase
of
manipulation
can
begin
What
are
a
gaslighter
s
tactics
BUTTON
Created
with
Sketch
A
gaslighter
will
initially
lie
about
simple
things
but
the
volume
of
misinformation
soon
grows
and
the
gaslighter
may
accuse
the
victim
of
lying
if
he
or
she
questions

Gaslighting
can
be
more
effective
and
successful
than
many
people
imagine
and
almost
anyone
can
be
susceptible
to
gaslighting
tactics
which
have
been
deployed
throughout
history
and
continue
to
be
used
today
by
domestic
abusers
dictators
narcissists
and
cult
leaders
The
most
effective
gaslighters
are
often
the

manipulation

Manipulation
is
a
key
part
of
gaslighting
but
manipulation
is
a
fairly
common
tactic
that
almost
anyone
is
capable
of
employing
while
gaslighting
and
gaslighters
are
more
rare
Children
for
example
try
to
manipulate
parents
at
an
early
age
and
marketers
aim
to
manipulate
consumers
but
gaslighting
involves
a
pattern
of
abusive
behaviors
with
the
intent
not
just
to
influence
someone

actually
to
control
them

Leaving
a
Gaslighter
wavebreakmedia

A
primary
goal
of
a
gaslighter
is
to
keep
their
victim
hooked
If
a
victim
disagrees
with
or
questions
the
abuser
he
or
she
may
try
to
make
it
seem
as
if
they
themselves
are
being
victimized
by
the
target
Alternately
they
may
try
to
lure
a
reluctant
partner
back
to
them
through
positive
reinforcement
Many
people
eventually
find
a
way
to
escape
a
gaslighter

Before
the
development
of

defined
ports
mariners
were
guided
by
fires
built
on

Since

placing

fire
on

platform
became
a
practice
that
led
to
the
development

the
lighthouse
functioned
more
as

entrance
marker
to
ports
than
as

The
modern
era
of
lighthouses
began
at
the
turn
of
the
th
century
as
the
number
of
lighthouses
being
constructed
increased
significantly
due
to
much
higher
levels
of
transatlantic
commerce
Advances
in
structural
engineering
and
new
and
efficient
lighting
equipment
allowed
for
the
creation
of
larger
and
more
powerful
lighthouses
including
ones
exposed
to
the
sea

function
of
lighthouses
was
gradually
changed

engineer
John

rebuilt
the
lighthouse
from
to
his
tower
marked
a
major
step
forward
in
the
design
of

and
remained
in
use
until
He
modeled
the
shape
of
his
lighthouse

blocks
He
rediscovered

used

Romans
and

advantage
of
allowing
some

the
energy
of
the
waves
to

source
of
illumination
had
generally
been
wood
pyres
or
burning
coal
The
Argand
lamp
invented
in
by
the
Swiss
scientist
Aim
Argand
revolutionized
lighthouse
illumination
with
its
steady
smokeless
flame
Early
models
used
ground
glass
which
was
sometimes
tinted
around
the
wick
Later
models
used
a
mantle
of
thorium
dioxide
suspended
over
the
flame
creating
a
bright
steady
light
The
Argand
lamp
used
whale
oil
colza
olive
oil
or
other
vegetable
oil
as
fuel
supplied
by
a
gravity
feed
from
a
reservoir
mounted
above
the
burner
The
lamp
was
first
produced
by
Matthew
Boulton
in
partnership
with
Argand
in
and
became
the
standard
for
lighthouses
for
over
a
century
Souter
Lighthouse
was
the
first
lighthouse
to
be
built
for
the
purpose
of
electric
illumination
in
South
Foreland
Lighthouse
was
the
first
tower
to
successfully
use
an
electric

in
The
lighthouse

John
Richardson
Wigham
was
the

illumination
of

With
the
development
of
the
steady
illumination
of
the
Argand
lamp
the
application
of
optical
lenses
to
increase
and
focus
the
light
intensity
became
a
practical
possibility
William
Hutchinson
developed
the
first
practical
optical
system
in
known
as
a
catoptric
system
This
rudimentary
system
effectively
collimated
the
emitted
light
into
a
concentrated
beam
thereby
greatly
increasing
the
light
s
visibility
The
ability
to
focus
the
light
led
to
the
first
revolving
lighthouse
beams
where
the
light
would
appear
to
the
mariners
as
a
series
of
intermittent
flashes
It
also
became
possible
to
transmit
complex
signals
using
the
light
flashes
French
physicist
and
engineer
Augustin
Jean
Fresnel
developed
the
multi
part
Fresnel
lens
for
use
in
lighthouses
His
design
allowed
for
the
construction
of
lenses
of
large
aperture
and
short
focal
length
without
the
mass
and
volume
of
material
that
would
be
required
by
a
lens
of
conventional
design
A
Fresnel
lens
can
be
made
much
thinner
than
a
comparable
conventional
lens
in
some
cases
taking
the
form
of
a
flat
sheet
A
Fresnel
lens
can
also
capture
more
oblique
light
from
a
light
source
thus
allowing
the
light
from
a
lighthouse
equipped
with
one
to
be
visible
over
greater
distances
The
first
Fresnel
lens
was
used
in
in
the
Cordouan
lighthouse
at
the
mouth
of
the
Gironde
estuary
its
light
could
be
seen
from
more
than
miles
km
out
Fresnel
s
invention
increased
the
luminosity
of
the
lighthouse
lamp
by
a
factor
of
four
and
his
system
is
still
in
common
use
Modern
lighthouses
edit
The
introduction
of
electrification
and
automatic
lamp
changers
began
to
make
lighthouse
keepers
obsolete
For
many
years
lighthouses
still
had
keepers
partly
because
lighthouse
keepers
could
serve
as
a
rescue
service
if
necessary
Improvements

In

many
remote
lighthouses
in

In

automated
lighthouses
the

is
often
replaced
by
a
high

light
that
emits
brief
omnidirectional

These
lights
are
similar

Ireland
about
a
third
of
lighthouses
had
been
converted
from
filament
light
sources
to
use
LEDs
and
conversion
continued
with
about
three
per
year
The
light
sources
are
designed
to
replicate
the
colour
and
character
of
the
traditional
light
as
closely
as
possible
The
change
is
often
not
noticed
by
people
in
the
region
but
sometimes
a
proposed
change
leads
to
calls
to
preserve
the
traditional

in
some
cases
a

A

of

Before
modern
strobe

lenses
were
used
to
concentrate
the
light
from
a
continuous
source
Vertical
light
rays
of
the
lamp
are
redirected
into
a
horizontal
plane
and
horizontally
the
light
is
focused
into
one
or
a
few
directions
at
a
time
with
the
light
beam
swept
around
As
a
result
in
addition
to
seeing
the
side
of
the
light
beam
the
light
is
directly
visible
from
greater
distances
and
with
an
identifying
light
characteristic
This
concentration
of
light
is
accomplished
with
a
rotating
lens
assembly
In
early
lighthouses
the
light
source
was
a
kerosene
lamp
or
earlier
an
animal
or
vegetable
oil
Argand

and
the
lenses
rotated
by
a
weight
driven
clockwork
assembly
wound
by
lighthouse
keepers
sometimes
as
often
as
every
two
hours
The
lens
assembly
sometimes
floated
in
liquid
mercury
to
reduce
friction
In
more
modern
lighthouses
electric
lights
and
motor
drives
were
used
generally
powered
by
diesel
electric
generators
These
also
supplied
electricity
for
the
lighthouse
keepers
Efficiently
concentrating
the
light
from
a
large
omnidirectional
light
source
requires
a
very
large
diameter

This
would
require

Such
paired
lighthouses
are
called
range

leading
lights
in
the
United

The
closer

is
referred

is
called
the

is
almost
always
taller
than
the
front
When
a

There
are
two
types
of
lighthouses
ones
that
are
located
on
land
and
ones
that
are
offshore
Offshore
Lighthouses
are
lighthouses
that
are
not
close
to
land
There
can
be
a
number
of
reasons
for
these
lighthouses
to
be
built
Offshore
lighthouses
are
commonly
used
to
project
sovereignty
or
territorial
assertions
over
maritime
claims
often
having
manifested
as
early
public
services
and
state
building
Examples
of
such
lighthouses
include
the
Raffles
Lighthouse
which
asserts
Singapore
s
southern
maritime
claims
the
Subi
Reef
lighthouse
which
asserts
the
disputed
Chinese
claim
over
the
South
China
Seas
and
Machias
Seal
Island
lighthouse
which
affirms
Canada
s
disputed
claim
in
its
boundary
dispute
with
the
United
States
of
America
in
the
Gulf
of
Maine
and
the
Bay
of
Fundy
There
can
be
a
shoal
reef
or
submerged
island
several
miles
from
land
The
current
Cordouan
Lighthouse
was
completed
in
kilometres
mi
from
the
shore
on
a
small
islet
but
was
built
on
a
previous
lighthouse
that
can
be
traced
back
to
the
s
and
is
the
oldest
surviving
lighthouse
in
France
It
is
connected
to
the
mainland
by
a
causeway
The
oldest
surviving
oceanic
offshore
lighthouse
is
Bell
Rock
Lighthouse
in
the

Allah
s
Light
Described
The
light
of
Allah
as
described
in
the
hadith
and
Qur
an
Abu
Musa
reported
The
Messenger
of
Allah
was
standing
amongst
us
and
he
told
us
five
things
He
said
Verily
the
Exalted
and
lowers
the
scale
and
lifts
it
The
deeds
in
the
night
are
taken
up
to
Him
before
the
deeds
of
the
day
and
the
deeds
of
the
day
before
the
deeds
of
the
night
His
veil
is
the
light
In
the
hadith
narrated
by
Abu
Bakr
instead
of
the
word
light
it
is
fire
If
he
withdraws
it
the
veil
the
splendor
of
His
countenance
would
consume
His
creation
so
far
as
His
sight
reaches
unconscious
And
when
he
awoke
he
said
Exalted
are
You
I
have
repented
to
You
and
I
am
the
first
of
the
believers
Qur
an
So
we
learn
that
Allah
s
light
is
too
powerful
to
be
witnessed
Vision
perceives
Him
not
but
He
perceives
all
vision
and
He
is
the
Subtle
the
Acquainted
Qur
an
The
Various
Interpretations
It
may
be
obvious
but
worth
mentioning
When
we
say
Allah
is
Al
Nur
The
Light
it
is
not
meant
in
the
literal
sense
The
light
we
see
is
created
and
is
not
eternal
It
gets
emitted
absorbed
reflected
and
refracted
Most
scholars
agree
for
it
to
be
a
name
and
attribute
of
Allah
it
must
be
understood
by
the
consequence
and
the
properties
of
light
Light
illuminates
makes
things
visible
and
shows
the
way
through
the
darkness
This
leads
to
many
interpretations
of
the
name
An
Nur
which
The
first
understanding
is
through
His
ability
to
manifest
creation
Darkness
is
the
absence
of
light
when
we
have
no
light
what
remains
is
darkness
Similarly
it
can
be
said
if
something
did
not
exist
it
was
hidden
or
unknown
Allah
has
the
power
to
they
would
not
be
known
A
second
interpretation
is
light
manifests
it
makes
things
that
are
hidden
visible
His
light
operates
at
many
levels
There
is
nothing
that
can
be
hidden
from
Him
He
is
the
Al
Baseer
All
Seeing
and
As
Sami
All
Hearing
His
light
reveals
and
nothing
escapes
His
view
And
with
Him
are
the
keys
of
the
unseen
none
knows
them
except
Him
And
He
knows
what
is
on
the
land
and
in
the
sea
Not
a
leaf
falls
but
He
also
illuminates
mankind
through
His
book
and
His
Messengers
may
peace
be
upon
them
He
s
a
guide
to
those
lost
So
in
this
sense
He
lights
upon
light
From
the
darkness
of
nonexistence
to
the
light
of
existence
from
unguided
to
guided
O
People
of
the
Scripture
there
has
come
to
you
Our
Messenger
making
clear
to
you
much
of
what
you
used
to
conceal
of
the
Scripture
and
overlooking
much
There
has
come
to
you
from
Allah
a
light
and
a
clear
Book
Qur
an
The
Darkness
Within
Allah
describes
Himself
in
verse
of
Surah
Nur
as
the
light
of
the
heaven
and
the
earth
Everything
that
comes
from
Him
comes
through
His
light
To
contrast
Shaykh
Tosun
Bayrak
mentions
how
the
light
of
faith
eliminates
the
darknesses
of
infidelity
and
sin
within
and
without
bringing
us
to
the
light
of
Truth
and
salvation
and
serenity
The
devil
and
one
s
own
devil
the
ego
are
those
who
like
to
operate
in
darkness
and
enter
dark
houses
they
will
not
enter
that
Divine
house
the
heart
illuminated
by
the
light
of
Faith
The
darkness
in
the
believer
is
their
ego
It
calls
us
to
pursue
pleasure
and
things
prohibited
to
pull
us
from
Allah
We
can
bring
light
into
our
life
and
the
world
by
and
large
through
following
the
commandments
of
Allah
By
keeping
ties

kinship
spreading

Translation
Allah
is
the
Light
of

and
the
earth
The
example
of
His
light
is
like
a
niche
within
which
is
a
lamp
the
lamp
is
within
glass
the
glass
as
if
it
were
a
pearly
white
star
lit
from
the
oil
of
a
blessed
olive
tree
neither
of
the
east
nor
of
the

whose
oil
would
almost
glow
even

untouched

Light

Allah
guides
to
His
light
whom
He
wills
And
Allah
presents
examples

Allah
is
Knowing

Qur
an
Supplication
of
Prophet
Muhammad
We
can
ask
Allah
to
bless
us
with
His
light
just
as
Prophet
Muhammad
taught
the
sahabah
English
Translation
O
Allah
place
light
in
my
heart
and
on
my
tongue
light
and
in
my
ears
light
and
in
my
sight
light
and
above
me
light
and
below
me
light
and
to
my
right
light
and
to
my
left
light
and
before
me
light
and
behind
me
light
Place
in
my
soul
light
Magnify
for
me
light
and
amplify
for
me
light
Make
for
me
light
and
make
me
a
light
O
Allah
grant
me
light
and
place
light
in
my
nerves
and
in
my
body
light
and
in
my
blood
light
and
in
my
hair
light
and
in
my

light
O
Allah
make
for
me
a
light
in
my
grave
and
a
light
in
my
bones
Increase
me
in

me

Reflecting
on
your
light
Every
person
has
a
light
that
emanates
from
them
The
intensity
at
which
it
shines
is
determined
by
their
upright
character
and
the
righteousness
of
their
deeds
Every
good
you
do
illuminates
the
path
toward
paradise
and
every
evil
takes
from
it
The
intention
of
the
believer
then
should
be
to
focus
on
ways
in
which
their
being
is
like
a
moth
to
a
flame
attracting
others
because
of
their
light
and
goodness
English
Translation
On
the
Day
you
see
the
believing
men
and
believing
women
their
light
proceeding
before
them
and
on
their
right
it
will
be
said
Your
good
tidings
today
are
of
gardens
beneath
which
rivers
flow
wherein
you
will
abide
eternally
That
is
what
is
the
great
attainment
On
the
same
Day
the
hypocrite
men
and
hypocrite
women
will
say
to
those
who
believed
Wait
for
us
that
we
may
acquire
some
of
your
light
It
will
be
said
Go
back
behind
you
and
seek
light
And
a
wall
will
be
placed
between
them
with
a
door
its
interior
containing
mercy
but
on
the
outside
of
it
is
torment
Qur
an
Ask
Allah
for
forgiveness
and
to
increase
your
light
so
we
don
t
suffer
the
fate
of
those
who
get
left
behind
because
their
light
was
too
weak
The
du
a
has
been
underlined
below
for
your
reference
Perhaps
your
Lord
will
remove
from
you
your
misdeeds
and
admit
you
into
gardens
beneath
which
rivers
flow
on
the
Day
when
Allah
will
not
disgrace
the
Prophet
and
those
who
believed
with
him
Their
light
will
proceed
before
them
and
on
their
right
they
will
say
Our
Lord
perfect
for
us
our
light
and
forgive
us
Indeed
You
are
over
all
things
competent

How
to
Lighten
Your
Heavy
Heart
When
our
minds
are
busy
we
can
be
easily
overwhelmed
and
distracted
The
heart
wants
what
the
heart
wants
but
there
are
ways
to
soothe
your
soul
and
to
lighten
your
heavy
heart
Write
down
your
heart
just
write
Expression
will
lighten
your
heavy
heart
Find
the
blessings
give
them
room
to
rush
in
Hope
will
lighten
your
heavy
heart
Make
time
to
heal
You
need
time
and
there
is
no
good
answer
to
how
long
It
will
take
as
long
as
it
takes
You
can
t
rush
your
heart
We
said
goodbye
to
our
sweet
dog
Guinness
more
than
months
ago
My
heart
is
lighter
than
it
was
in
the
days
that
followed
that
painful
goodbye
but
there
are
still
days
when
I
get
teary
or
really
really
miss
him
Patience
will
lighten
your
heavy
heart
Take
action
isn
t
enough
It
is
Contribution
will
lighten
your
heavy
heart
Share
your
heart
out
and
share
your
heart
Give
others
a
chance
to
say
yes
me
too
Solidarity
will
lighten
your
heavy
heart
If
your
heart
is
heavy
today
and
it
s
too
soon
to
consider
these
recommendations
come
back
when
you
re
ready
In
the
meantime
be
open
to
the
light
and
look
for
the
stars

Light

the

Light

As

As
both
Merriam

Webster
so
clearly
define

H
J
Forman
lightheartedly
adverb
lightheartedness
noun
Lighthearted
free
from

or

happy
go
lucky
When
you
re
with
friends
maybe
even
neighbors
and
the
invitation
to
play
is
just
that
an
invitation
And
everybody
is
there
for
no
other
reason
than
to
have
fun
together
You
become
lighthearted
And
the
light
of
your
lighthearted
heart
is
shared
A
weight
is
lifted
A
separation
healed
A
connection
made
visible
It
becomes
a
light
that
illuminates
everything
You
feel
a
certain
trust
in
each
other
a
certain
certainty
People
are
without
alcohol
even
So
nothing
can
come
between
you
and
the
authenticity
of
your
experience
It
s
really
you
Really
them
It
s
magic
is
what
it
is
this
shared
light
this
heart
The
fun
of
it
all
is
so
much
more
encompassing
simply
because
you
re
doing
it
freely
together
in
full
consciousness
wholeheartedly
and
wholebodily
This
is
the
way
it
is
when
you
come
together
to
for
fun
You
let
loose
You
let
the
light
of
being
together
into
your
very
heart
You
let
the
fun
in
You
let
each
other
in
Laughing
hearts
Loving
hearts
Light
hearts
Much
very
much
to
the
delight
of
all
