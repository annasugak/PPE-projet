Photosynthetic Cells



   Cells get nutrients from their environment, but where do those
   nutrients come from? Virtually all organic material on Earth has been
   produced by cells that convert energy from the Sun into
   energy-containing macromolecules. This process, called photosynthesis,
   is essential to the global carbon cycle and organisms that conduct
   photosynthesis represent the lowest level in most food chains (Figure
   1).

   Ten photographs provide examples of diverse photosynthetic plant
   morphologies. Some plants pictured are simple and small, and were
   photographed using a microscope. Others are macroscopic and have
   elaborate reproductive structures or leaves.
   Figure 1: Photosynthetic plants synthesize carbon-based energy
   molecules from the energy in sunlight. Consequently, they provide an
   abundance of energy for other organisms.
   Plants exist in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. (A) Coleochaete

What Is Photosynthesis? Why Is it Important?

   Most living things depend on photosynthetic cells to manufacture the
   complex organic molecules they require as a source of energy.
   Photosynthetic cells are quite diverse and include cells found in green
   plants, phytoplankton, and cyanobacteria. During the process of
   photosynthesis, cells use carbon dioxide and energy from the Sun to
   make sugar molecules and oxygen. These sugar molecules are the basis
   for more complex molecules made by the photosynthetic cell, such as
   glucose. Then, via respiration processes, cells use oxygen and glucose
   to synthesize energy-rich carrier molecules, such as ATP, and carbon
   dioxide is produced as a waste product. Therefore, the synthesis of
   glucose and its breakdown by cells are opposing processes.

   [7]A diagram shows the interactions between plant, soil, river, and
   ocean systems during the carbon cycle. Arrows are used to represent
   storage or flow of inorganic carbon and organic carbon, or to give
   directionality to photosynthesis or decomposition processes between
   land plants, soil, aquatic systems, and the Earth's atmosphere.

   The building and breaking of carbon-based material — from carbon
   dioxide to complex organic molecules (photosynthesis) then back to
   carbon dioxide (respiration) — is part of what is commonly called the
   global carbon cycle. Indeed, the fossil fuels we use to power our world
   today are the ancient remains of once-living organisms, and they
   provide a dramatic example of this cycle at work. The carbon cycle
   would not be possible without photosynthesis, because this process
   accounts for the "building" portion of the cycle (Figure 2).

   However, photosynthesis doesn't just drive the carbon cycle — it also
   creates the oxygen necessary for respiring organisms. Interestingly,
   although green plants contribute much of the oxygen in the air we
   breathe, phytoplankton and cyanobacteria in the world's oceans are
   thought to produce between one-third and one-half of atmospheric oxygen
   on Earth.

What Cells and Organelles Are Involved in Photosynthesis?

   An illustration of a chloroplast shows its primary structural features.
   A section of the organelle is cut away to provide a window into its
   interior structures. The outermost, translucent membrane is labeled the
   outer membrane. An interior membrane, visible where the organelle has
   been cut away, is labeled the inner membrane. Inside the organelle,
   thirteen interconnected stacks of green discs are labeled thylakoid,
   and the empty interior space is labeled stroma.

   Photosynthetic cells contain special pigments that absorb light energy.
   Different pigments respond to different wavelengths of visible light.
   Chlorophyll, the primary pigment used in photosynthesis, reflects green
   light and absorbs red and blue light most strongly. In plants,
   photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts, which contain the
   chlorophyll. Chloroplasts are surrounded by a double membrane and
   contain a third inner membrane, called the thylakoid membrane, that
   forms long folds within the organelle. In electron micrographs,
   thylakoid membranes look like stacks of coins, although the
   compartments they form are connected like a maze of chambers. The green
   pigment chlorophyll is located within the thylakoid membrane, and the
   space between the thylakoid and the chloroplast membranes is called the
   stroma (Figure 3, Figure 4).

   Chlorophyll A is the major pigment used in photosynthesis, but there
   are several types of chlorophyll and numerous other pigments that
   respond to light, including red, brown, and blue pigments. These other
   pigments may help channel light energy to chlorophyll A or protect the
   cell from photo-damage. For example, the photosynthetic protists called
   dinoflagellates, which are responsible for the "red tides" that often
   prompt warnings against eating shellfish, contain a variety of
   light-sensitive pigments, including both chlorophyll and the red
   pigments responsible for their dramatic coloration.

   Photomicrographs of chloroplasts with structures labeled are shown
   alongside a simplified illustration of a photosynthetic cell with a
   prominent chloroplast. A portion of the chloroplast illustration is
   depicted enlarged next to the cell to show the structure of a granum,
   which consists of stacked thylakoids.
   Figure 4: Diagram of a chloroplast inside a cell, showing thylakoid
   stacks
   Shown here is a chloroplast inside a cell, with the outer membrane (OE)
   and inner membrane (IE) labeled. Other features of the cell include the
   nucleus (N), mitochondrion (M), and plasma membrane (PM). At right and
   below are microscopic images of thylakoid stacks called grana. Note the
   relationship between the granal and stromal membranes.

What Are the Steps of Photosynthesis?

   Photosynthesis consists of both light-dependent reactions and
   light-independent reactions. In plants, the so-called "light" reactions
   occur within the chloroplast thylakoids, where the aforementioned
   chlorophyll pigments reside. When light energy reaches the pigment
   molecules, it energizes the electrons within them, and these electrons
   are shunted to an electron transport chain in the thylakoid membrane.
   Every step in the electron transport chain then brings each electron to
   a lower energy state and harnesses its energy by producing ATP and
   NADPH. Meanwhile, each chlorophyll molecule replaces its lost electron
   with an electron from water; this process essentially splits water
   molecules to produce oxygen (Figure 5).

   An illustration shows the light and dark reactions for photosynthesis
   drawn on top of a simplified image of a chloroplast, represented as an
   oviform capsule. Inside the capsule are five stacks of three or four
   flat, green thylakoid discs. The discs look like stacked quarters. Two
   thylakoid stacks have been cut away so that their interiors, which are
   hollow, are visible.
   Figure 5: The light and dark reactions in the chloroplast
   The chloroplast is involved in both stages of photosynthesis. The light
   reactions take place in the thylakoid. There, water (H[2]O) is
   oxidized, and oxygen (O[2]) is released. The electrons that freed from
   the water are transferred to ATP and NADPH. The dark reactions then
   occur outside the thylakoid. In these reactions, the energy from ATP
   and NADPH is used to fix carbon dioxide (CO[2]). The products of this
   reaction are sugar molecules and various other organic molecules
   necessary for cell function and metabolism. Note that the dark reaction
   takes place in the stroma (the aqueous fluid surrounding the stacks of
   thylakoids) and in the cytoplasm.

   [18]Figure Detail

   Once the light reactions have occurred, the light-independent or "dark"
   reactions take place in the chloroplast stroma. During this process,
   also known as carbon fixation, energy from the ATP and NADPH molecules
   generated by the light reactions drives a chemical pathway that uses
   the carbon in carbon dioxide (from the atmosphere) to build a
   three-carbon sugar called glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). Cells then
   use G3P to build a wide variety of other sugars (such as glucose) and
   organic molecules. Many of these interconversions occur outside the
   chloroplast, following the transport of G3P from the stroma. The
   products of these reactions are then transported to other parts of the
   cell, including the mitochondria, where they are broken down to make
   more energy carrier molecules to satisfy the metabolic demands of the
   cell. In plants, some sugar molecules are stored as sucrose or starch.

Conclusion

   Photosynthetic cells contain chlorophyll and other light-sensitive
   pigments that capture solar energy. In the presence of carbon dioxide,
   such cells are able to convert this solar energy into energy-rich
   organic molecules, such as glucose. These cells not only drive the
   global carbon cycle, but they also produce much of the oxygen present
   in atmosphere of the Earth. Essentially, nonphotosynthetic cells use
   the products of photosynthesis to do the opposite of photosynthesis:
   break down glucose and release carbon dioxide.
