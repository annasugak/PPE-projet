   Diet Coke can on grey background

   History was made 41 years ago with the creation of Diet Coke. Within
   two years, Diet Coke was the world’s favourite light cola, and it still
   is! Diet Coke encourages you to love what you love, celebrating the
   unapologetic attitude that comes with knowing who you are and what
   you’re into, whether it’s ‘cool’ or not. So add some sparkle to your
   day - without sugar or calories - with a crisp, refreshing Diet Coke!
