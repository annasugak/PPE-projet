How to Lighten Your Heavy Heart

   Courtney Carver by Courtney Carver Oct 22, 2024
   How to Lighten Your Heavy Heart

   When our minds are busy, we can be easily overwhelmed and distracted,
   but our brains usually find a way to process and release. Our hearts on
   the other hand, hold everything dearly.

   Our hearts hold love and joy, but they also hold pain, worry, guilt and
   sadness. Our hearts helps us feel all the things, and not just our own
   things. Our hearts take on the whole world. Sometimes it’s too much
   though, and all of those feelings get heavy. When our hearts overflow
   with the heavy stuff, we ask questions like …
     * Why am I so sad?
     * Why does this hurt so much?
     * Will I get through this?
     * When will I feel better?
     * What can I do?

   Or, instead of asking the questions, we shut down. Our hearts close for
   business for a while and we disconnect from all the feelings, even the
   good ones. It’s in that time that we usually become apathetic,
   depressed, lonely, or hopeless.

   The heart wants what the heart wants, but there are ways to soothe your
   soul, and to lighten your heavy heart.

   Write down your heart.
   This is almost always my first response to pain, grief, sadness, or any
   strong emotion or reaction. I’ve learned from experience that acting
   from an unstable place generally leads to overreacting and words I
   wished I never said out loud. Instead, I put my heart on paper first. I
   write it all down. Even if it sounds crazy or messy, I don’t judge. I
   just write.

   Expression will lighten your heavy heart.

   Find the blessings.
   In every tragedy, or painful time, there are blessings. They
   don’t justify the pain, but when you keep your heart open to the
   goodness, you can see the way through. Whatever your struggle is today,
   claim your openness to the blessings that have yet to appear and then
   give them room to rush in.

   Hope will lighten your heavy heart.

   Make time to heal.
   The best strategies in the world will not speed up the healing process.
   You need time, and there is no good answer to “how long?” It will take
   as long as it takes. You can’t rush your heart. We said goodbye to our
   sweet dog Guinness more than 6 months ago. My heart is lighter than it
   was in the days that followed that painful goodbye, but there are still
   days when I get teary, or really, really miss him.

   Patience will lighten your heavy heart.

   Take action.
   When you feel hopeless or helpless, taking action helps. Give your
   time, talent, and treasure with the intention of relieving someone’s
   pain. In a recent essay, author Elizabeth Gilbert said, “But when the
   world starts to feel overwhelming in its sorrows, I always ask myself
   to look around me — to narrow down my focus — and to notice somebody
   who is nearby me, who is suffering. I can’t help the millions, but
   maybe I can help one. You never have to look very far to find a
   suffering soul.”

   Give in the best way you can, and don’t let anyone tell you your gift
   isn’t enough. It is.

   Contribution will lighten your heavy heart.

   Share your heart.
   Call a friend. Share something on your favorite social platform. Reach
   out and share your heart. Give others a chance to say, “yes, me too.”

   Solidarity will lighten your heavy heart.

   If your heart is heavy today, and it’s too soon to consider these
   recommendations, come back when you’re ready. In the meantime, be open
   to the light and look for the stars.

About Courtney Carver

   Oh hi! I'm Courtney and I've been simplifying my life since 2010. I
   remove the things that remove me from life. Things like clutter, debt,
   alcohol, busyness and drama. Now I have time for the good stuff like
   peace, ease, creativity, laughter and love. Let's simplify together,
   not so we can have a simple life, but so we can have the life we really
   want.
