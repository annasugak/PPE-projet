   When it comes to choosing the perfect weights for your sets, the
   heavier, the better, right? Surely, there's no point in reaching for
   lighter weights if your goal is to gain as much muscle as possible.

   While swinging the heaviest dumbbells may seem like the fastest track
   to gym cred, it's well known that cheating your reps may not be the
   most optimal path to hypertrophy. Plus, if you want to build explosive
   power, shortchanging yourself with your weight choice isn't going to
   cut it.

   So, which is best? MH breaks down the latest research and how it
   relates to your training goals so that you can achieve the results you
   want.

What to read next

Is It Better to Do Heavy or Light Weights?

   Whether you choose to use heavy weights with low reps or light weights
   with high reps will comes down to a few considerations:
     * Your goals: Muscle growth, strength or endurance
     * Training experience: Beginner, intermediate or advanced
     * Your preferences: What you enjoy doing the most
     * Current training frequency: This will effect your capacity to
       recover in time between sessions depending on the weights used
     * Current or past injuries: This will effect the load at which you
       can lift and your exercise selection
     * Equipment available: Lighter weights typically use less plates and
       total equipment
     * Fatigue levels: If you're feeling particularly tired or are in a
       fat loss phase, heavier weights can feel more taxing, therefore
       effecting weight choice

Can You Build Muscle with Light Weights, High Reps?

   You can build muscle with a variety of rep ranges and weight choices.
   The most important factor is the proximity to failure. Researchers in a
   study published by PeerJ set out to find out what exactly happens when
   there is a focus on increasing reps versus load to facilitate
   progressive overload. They concluded that increasing repetitions and
   load both appear to be good strategies for increasing muscle mass.

Can You Build Muscle with Heavy Weights, Low Reps?

   A study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research
   compares high reps with lower weights to lower reps with higher
   weights, with both groups working to failure. The study found that the
   muscle size results for both groups were similar. However, for strength
   gains, the subjects using higher weights and lower reps saw the most
   benefit. When it comes to gaining muscle, as long as you're working
   close to failure, the weight you choose becomes less important. What is
   most crucial for muscle gains is proximity to failure. Pushing
   ourselves to within 0-5 reps of failure should be sufficient.

   Another study published in Sports Medicine confirms this. The
   meta-analysis aimed to investigate the relationship between estimated
   proximity to failure (reps in reserve) during resistance training with
   two main focuses: strength gains and muscle hypertrophy. The study
   concluded that for strength it is more important to focus on heavier
   loads, however, not working to failure. For muscle growth, it showed
   that working closer to failure was beneficial for muscle growth.

Do Bodybuilders Lift Heavy or Light?

   Bodybuilders will predominantly work with higher rep ranges and
   lighter/moderate weights. However, many will work with a variety of rep
   ranges and weights in order to build muscle mass and strength.

   Many bodybuilders tend to do cutting and bulking phases. If they are in
   a cutting phase (fat loss/calorie deficit phase) working with higher
   reps and lighter weights is preferential due to the reduced
   neurological impact compared to heavier weights. They are usually
   starting sessions with a higher level of fatigue, which would mean
   lighter weights would be more suitable while still increasing
   hypertrophy. When they are in a bulking phase (muscle gain/calorie
   surplus phase) they will tend to include more heavy lifts with lower
   rep ranges, when they are training with high energy levels.

The Verdict

For Hypertrophy

   Both lighter weights with higher reps and heavier weights with lower
   reps increase muscle mass. What is most important is the proximity to
   failure in which you work at the end of your sets. While you don't have
   to work to failure, working close is ideal. Aim for 8-15 reps per set
   and to finish your sets 0-5 reps short of failure.

For Strength

   For strength, it is more important to focus on heavier loads. This is
   because heavier weights recruit more muscular motor units and
   contribute to greater strength gains. However, you don't have to work
   to failure. Training to failure can be very demanding on the body and
   more difficult to recover from in subsequent sets. With varied evidence
   showing strength improvements from working close to failure, we can
   assume that aiming for 3-8 reps per set and finishing 3-5 reps short of
   failure is the sweet spot for strength training while also mitigating
   risks.
