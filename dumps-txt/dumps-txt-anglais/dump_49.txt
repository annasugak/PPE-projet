   Structure designed to emit light to aid navigation
   For other uses, see [187]Lighthouse (disambiguation).

   [194]Roman Rock Lighthouse off the southern coast of South Africa.

   A lighthouse is a tower, building, or other type of physical structure
   designed to emit light from a system of lamps and [195]lenses and to
   serve as a [196]beacon for [197]navigational aid for [198]maritime
   pilots at sea or on inland waterways.

   Lighthouses mark dangerous coastlines, hazardous [199]shoals,
   [200]reefs, rocks, and safe entries to harbors; they also assist in
   [201]aerial navigation. Once widely used, the number of operational
   lighthouses has declined due to the expense of maintenance and the
   advent of much cheaper, more sophisticated, and more effective
   electronic navigational systems.

History

   [[202]edit]

Ancient lighthouses

   [[204]edit]
   [205][250px-Torre_de_H%C3%A9rcules_2023.jpg] The [206]Tower of Hercules
   lighthouse in north-western Spain

   Before the development of clearly defined [207]ports, mariners were
   guided by fires built on hilltops. Since elevating the fire would
   improve visibility, placing the fire on a platform became a practice
   that led to the development of the lighthouse.^[208][1] In antiquity,
   the lighthouse functioned more as an entrance marker to ports than as a
   warning signal for [209]reefs and [210]promontories, unlike many modern
   lighthouses. The most famous lighthouse structure from antiquity was
   the [211]Pharos of [212]Alexandria, [213]Egypt, which collapsed
   following a series of earthquakes between 956 and 1323.

   The intact [214]Tower of Hercules at [215]A Coruña, Spain gives insight
   into ancient lighthouse construction; other evidence about lighthouses
   exists in depictions on coins and mosaics, of which many represent the
   lighthouse at [216]Ostia. Coins from Alexandria, Ostia, and
   [217]Laodicea in Syria also exist.

Modern construction

   [[218]edit]

   The modern era of lighthouses began at the turn of the 18th century, as
   the number of lighthouses being constructed increased significantly due
   to much higher levels of [219]transatlantic commerce. Advances in
   structural engineering and new and efficient lighting equipment allowed
   for the creation of larger and more powerful lighthouses, including
   ones exposed to the sea. The function of lighthouses was gradually
   changed from indicating ports to the providing of a visible warning
   against shipping hazards, such as rocks or reefs.
   [220][250px-Edystone_Winstanley_lighthouse_Smeaton_1813.jpg] Original
   [221]Winstanley lighthouse, Eddystone Rock, by Jaaziell Johnston, 1813.

   The [222]Eddystone Rocks were a major shipwreck hazard for mariners
   sailing through the [223]English Channel.^[224][2] The [225]first
   lighthouse built there was an octagonal wooden structure, anchored by
   12 iron stanchions secured in the rock, and was built by [226]Henry
   Winstanley from 1696 to 1698. His lighthouse was the first tower in the
   world to have been fully exposed to the open sea.^[227][3]

   The [228]civil engineer [229]John Smeaton rebuilt the [230]lighthouse
   from 1756 to 1759;^[231][4] his tower marked a major step forward in
   the design of lighthouses and remained in use until 1877. He modeled
   the shape of his lighthouse on that of an [232]oak tree, using
   [233]granite blocks. He rediscovered and used "[234]hydraulic lime", a
   form of [235]concrete that will set under water used by the Romans, and
   developed a technique of securing the granite blocks together using
   [236]dovetail joints and marble [237]dowels.^[238][5] The dovetailing
   feature served to improve the [239]structural stability, although
   Smeaton also had to taper the thickness of the tower towards the top,
   for which he curved the tower inwards on a gentle gradient. This
   profile had the added advantage of allowing some of the energy of the
   waves to dissipate on impact with the walls. His lighthouse was the
   prototype for the modern lighthouse and influenced all subsequent
   engineers.^[240][6]
   [241][321px-Smeaton%27s_Lighthouse00.jpg] [242]John Smeaton's rebuilt
   version of the [243]Eddystone Lighthouse, 1759. This represented a
   great step forward in lighthouse design.

   One such influence was [244]Robert Stevenson, himself a seminal figure
   in the development of lighthouse design and construction.^[245][7] His
   greatest achievement was the construction of the [246]Bell Rock
   Lighthouse in 1810, one of the most impressive feats of engineering of
   the age.^[[247]citation needed] This structure was based upon Smeaton's
   design, but with several improved features, such as the incorporation
   of rotating lights, alternating between red and white.^[248][8]
   Stevenson worked for the [249]Northern Lighthouse Board for nearly
   fifty years^[250][7] during which time he designed and oversaw the
   construction and later improvement of numerous lighthouses. He
   innovated in the choice of light sources, mountings, reflector design,
   the use of [251]Fresnel lenses, and in rotation and shuttering systems
   providing lighthouses with individual signatures allowing them to be
   identified by seafarers. He also invented the movable jib and the
   balance-crane as a necessary part for lighthouse construction.
   [252][330px-Marjaniemen_majakka.jpg] [253]Marjaniemi Lighthouse, the
   19th-century lighthouse in the [254]Hailuoto island, neighbouring
   municipality of [255]Oulu, [256]Finland

   [257]Alexander Mitchell designed the first [258]screw-pile lighthouse –
   his lighthouse was built on piles that were [259]screwed into the sandy
   or muddy seabed. Construction of his design began in 1838 at the mouth
   of the [260]Thames and was known as the [261]Maplin Sands lighthouse,
   and first lit in 1841.^[262][9] Although its construction began later,
   the [263]Wyre Light in Fleetwood, Lancashire, was the first to be lit
   (in 1840).^[264][9]

Lighting improvements

   [[265]edit]

   Until 1782 the source of illumination had generally been wood pyres or
   burning coal. The [266]Argand lamp, invented in 1782 by the Swiss
   scientist [267]Aimé Argand revolutionized lighthouse illumination with
   its steady smokeless flame. Early models used ground glass which was
   sometimes tinted around the wick. Later models used a [268]mantle of
   [269]thorium dioxide suspended over the flame, creating a bright,
   steady light.^[270][10] The Argand lamp used [271]whale oil,
   [272]colza, [273]olive oil^[274][11] or other [275]vegetable oil as
   fuel, supplied by a [276]gravity feed from a reservoir mounted above
   the burner. The lamp was first produced by [277]Matthew Boulton, in
   partnership with Argand, in 1784, and became the standard for
   lighthouses for over a century.^[278][12]

   [279]Souter Lighthouse was the first lighthouse to be built for the
   purpose of electric illumination in 1871.^[280][13]

   [281]South Foreland Lighthouse was the first tower to successfully use
   an electric light in 1875. The lighthouse's carbon [282]arc lamps were
   powered by a steam-driven [283]magneto.^[284][14] [285]John Richardson
   Wigham was the first to develop a system for [286]gas illumination of
   lighthouses. His improved gas 'crocus' burner at the [287]Baily
   Lighthouse in county Dublin, Ireland, near Dublin city was 13 times
   more powerful than the most brilliant light then known.^[288][15]
   [289][250px-Sumburgh_Lighthouse_Lamp.jpg] An 85 millimetres (3.3 in)
   Chance Brothers Incandescent Petroleum Vapour Installation which
   produced the light for the [290]Sumburgh Head lighthouse until 1976.
   The lamp (made in approx. 1914) burned vaporized [291]kerosene
   (paraffin); the vaporizer was heated by a [292]denatured alcohol
   (methylated spirit) burner to light. When lit, some of the vaporised
   fuel was diverted to a [293]Bunsen burner to keep the vaporizer warm
   and the fuel in vapor form. The fuel was forced up to the lamp by air;
   the keepers had to pump the air container up every hour or so,
   pressurizing the paraffin container to force the fuel to the lamp. The
   "white sock" pictured is an unburnt mantle on which the vapor burned.

   The vaporized oil burner was invented in 1901 by [294]Arthur Kitson,
   and improved by David Hood at [295]Trinity House. The fuel was
   vaporized at high pressure and burned to heat the mantle, giving an
   output of over six times the luminosity of traditional oil
   lights.^[[296]citation needed] The use of gas as illuminant became
   widely available with the invention of the [297]Dalén light by Swedish
   engineer [298]Gustaf Dalén. He used [299]Agamassan (Aga), a
   [300]substrate, to absorb the gas, allowing the gas to be stored, and
   hence used, safely. Dalén also invented the '[301]sun valve', which
   automatically regulated the light and turned it off during the
   daytime.^[[302]This paragraph needs citation(s)] The technology was the
   predominant light source in lighthouses from the 1900s to the 1960s,
   when electric lighting had become dominant.^[303][16]

Optical systems

   [[304]edit]
   [305][250px-Fresnel_lighthouse_lens_diagram.png] Diagram depicting how
   a spherical [306]Fresnel lens collimates light

   With the development of the steady illumination of the Argand lamp, the
   application of optical lenses to increase and focus the light intensity
   became a practical possibility. [307]William Hutchinson developed the
   first practical optical system in 1777, known as a [308]catoptric
   system.^[309][17] This rudimentary system effectively collimated the
   emitted light into a concentrated beam, thereby greatly increasing the
   light's visibility.^[310][18] The ability to focus the light led to the
   first revolving lighthouse beams, where the light would appear to the
   mariners as a series of intermittent flashes. It also became possible
   to transmit complex signals using the light flashes.

   French physicist and engineer [311]Augustin-Jean Fresnel developed the
   multi-part [312]Fresnel lens for use in lighthouses. His design allowed
   for the construction of lenses of large [313]aperture and short
   [314]focal length, without the mass and volume of material that would
   be required by a lens of conventional design. A Fresnel lens can be
   made much thinner than a comparable conventional lens, in some cases
   taking the form of a flat sheet. A Fresnel lens can also capture more
   oblique light from a light source, thus allowing the light from a
   lighthouse equipped with one to be visible over greater distances.

   The first Fresnel lens was used in 1823 in the [315]Cordouan lighthouse
   at the mouth of the [316]Gironde estuary; its light could be seen from
   more than 20 miles (32 km) out.^[317][19] Fresnel's invention increased
   the [318]luminosity of the lighthouse lamp by a factor of four and his
   system is still in common use.

Modern lighthouses

   [[319]edit]

   The introduction of electrification and [320]automatic lamp changers
   began to make [321]lighthouse keepers obsolete. For many years,
   lighthouses still had keepers, partly because lighthouse keepers could
   serve as a [322]rescue service, if necessary. Improvements in maritime
   navigation and safety, such [323]Global Positioning System (GPS), led
   to the phasing out of non-automated lighthouses across the
   world.^[324][20] Although several closed due to safety concerns, Canada
   still maintains 51 staffed lighthouses, split roughly evenly across
   east and west coasts, including [325]Machias Seal Island which is
   staffed to assert Canadian sovereignty.^[326][21]^[327][22]^[328][23]

   The remaining modern lighthouses are usually illuminated by a single
   stationary flashing light powered by solar-charged batteries and
   mounted on a steel skeleton tower.^[329][24] Where the power
   requirement is too great for solar power alone, cycle charging of the
   battery by a Diesel generator is provided. The generator only comes
   into use when the battery needs charging, saving fuel and increasing
   periods between maintenance.^[330][25]

Famous lighthouse builders

   [[331]edit]

   [332]John Smeaton is noteworthy for having designed the third and most
   famous [333]Eddystone Lighthouse, but some builders are well known for
   their work in building multiple lighthouses. The Stevenson family
   ([334]Robert, [335]Alan, [336]David, [337]Thomas, [338]David Alan, and
   [339]Charles) made lighthouse building a three-generation profession in
   Scotland. [340]Richard Henry Brunton designed and built 26
   [341]Japanese lighthouses in [342]Meiji era Japan, which became known
   as Brunton's "children".^[343][26] Blind Irishman [344]Alexander
   Mitchell invented and built a number of screw-pile lighthouses.
   Englishman [345]James Douglass was knighted for his work on the fourth
   Eddystone Lighthouse.^[346][27]

   [347]United States Army Corps of Engineers Lieutenant [348]George Meade
   built numerous lighthouses along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts before
   gaining wider fame as the winning general at the [349]Battle of
   Gettysburg. Colonel [350]Orlando M. Poe, engineer to [351]General
   William Tecumseh Sherman in the siege of Atlanta, designed and built
   some of the most exotic lighthouses in the most difficult locations on
   the U.S. [352]Great Lakes.^[353][28]

   French merchant navy officer [354]Marius Michel Pasha built almost a
   hundred lighthouses along the coasts of the [355]Ottoman Empire in a
   period of twenty years after the [356]Crimean War
   (1853–1856).^[357][29]

Technology

   [[358]edit]

   In a lighthouse, the source of light is called the "lamp" (whether
   electric or fuelled by oil) and the light is concentrated, if needed,
   by the "lens" or "optic". Power sources for lighthouses in the
   20th–21st centuries vary.

Power

   [[359]edit]

   Originally lit by open fires and later candles, the [360]Argand hollow
   wick lamp and [361]parabolic reflector were introduced in the late 18th
   century.

   [362]Whale oil was also used with wicks as the source of light.
   [363]Kerosene became popular in the 1870s and electricity and
   [364]acetylene gas derived on-site from [365]calcium carbide began
   replacing kerosene around the turn of the 20th century.^[366][24]
   Carbide was promoted by the [367]Dalén light, which automatically lit
   the lamp at nightfall and extinguished it at dawn.

   In the second half of the 20th century, many remote lighthouses in
   [368]Russia (then [369]Soviet Union) were powered by [370]radioisotope
   thermoelectric generators (RTGs). These had the advantage of providing
   power day or night and did not need refuelling or maintenance. However,
   after the collapse of the Soviet government in 1990s, most of the
   official records on the locations, and condition, of these lighthouses
   were reportedly lost.^[371][30] Over time, the condition of RTGs in
   Russia degraded; many of them fell victim to vandalism and scrap metal
   thieves, who may not have been aware of the dangerous radioactive
   contents.^[372][31]

   Energy-efficient LED lights can be powered by [373]solar panels, with
   batteries instead of a Diesel generator for backup.^[374][32]

Light source

   [[375]edit]

   Many Fresnel lens installations have been replaced by rotating
   [376]aerobeacons, which require less maintenance.

   In modern automated lighthouses, the system of rotating lenses is often
   replaced by a high intensity light that emits brief omnidirectional
   flashes, concentrating the light in time rather than direction. These
   lights are similar to obstruction lights used to warn aircraft of tall
   structures. Later innovations were "Vega Lights", and experiments with
   [377]light-emitting diode (LED) panels.^[378][24]

   LED lights, which use less energy and are easier to maintain, had come
   into widespread use by 2020. In the United Kingdom and Ireland about a
   third of lighthouses had been converted from filament light sources to
   use LEDs, and conversion continued with about three per year. The light
   sources are designed to replicate the colour and character of the
   traditional light as closely as possible. The change is often not
   noticed by people in the region, but sometimes a proposed change leads
   to calls to preserve the traditional light, including in some cases a
   rotating beam. A typical LED system designed to fit into the
   traditional 19th century Fresnel lens enclosure was developed by
   Trinity House and two other lighthouse authorities and costs about
   [379]€20,000, depending on configuration, according to a supplier; it
   has large fins to dissipate heat. Lifetime of the LED light source is
   50,000 to 100,000 hours, compared to about 1,000 hours for a filament
   source.^[380][32]

Laser light

   [[381]edit]
   [382][250px-Point_Danger_lighthouse.jpg] [383]Point Danger lighthouse,
   [384]Queensland, 1971

   Experimental installations of [385]laser lights, either at high power
   to provide a "line of light" in the sky or, utilising low power, aimed
   towards mariners have identified problems of increased complexity in
   installation and maintenance, and high power requirements. The first
   practical installation, in 1971 at [386]Point Danger lighthouse,
   [387]Queensland, was replaced by a conventional light after four years,
   because the beam was too narrow to be seen easily.^[388][33]^[389][34]

Light characteristics

   [[390]edit]
   See also: [391]Light characteristic

   In any of these designs an observer, rather than seeing a continuous
   weak light, sees a brighter light during short time intervals. These
   instants of bright light are arranged to create a [392]light
   characteristic or pattern specific to a lighthouse.^[393][35] For
   example, the [394]Scheveningen Lighthouse flashes are alternately 2.5
   and 7.5 seconds. Some lights have sectors of a particular color
   (usually formed by colored panes in the lantern) to distinguish safe
   water areas from dangerous shoals. Modern lighthouses often have unique
   reflectors or [395]racon transponders so the radar signature of the
   light is also unique.

Lens

   [[396]edit]
   See also: [397]Fresnel lens
   [398][250px-Cape_Meares_Lighthouse_lens_-_Oregon.jpg] [399]Cape Meares
   Lighthouse in Oregon; first-order Fresnel lens

   Before modern [400]strobe lights, [401]lenses were used to concentrate
   the light from a continuous source. Vertical light rays of the lamp are
   redirected into a horizontal plane, and horizontally the light is
   focused into one or a few directions at a time, with the [402]light
   beam swept around. As a result, in addition to seeing the side of the
   light beam, the light is directly visible from greater distances, and
   with an identifying [403]light characteristic.

   This concentration of light is accomplished with a rotating lens
   assembly. In early lighthouses, the light source was a [404]kerosene
   lamp or, earlier, an animal or vegetable oil Argand lamp, and the
   lenses rotated by a weight driven clockwork assembly wound by
   lighthouse keepers, sometimes as often as every two hours. The lens
   assembly sometimes floated in [405]liquid mercury to reduce friction.
   In more modern lighthouses, electric lights and motor drives were used,
   generally powered by diesel electric generators. These also supplied
   electricity for the lighthouse keepers.^[406][24]

   Efficiently concentrating the light from a large omnidirectional light
   source requires a very large diameter lens. This would require a very
   thick and heavy lens if a conventional lens were used. The [407]Fresnel
   lens (pronounced [408]/freɪˈnɛl/) focused 85% of a lamp's light versus
   the 20% focused with the parabolic reflectors of the time. Its design
   enabled construction of lenses of large size and short focal length
   without the weight and volume of material in conventional lens
   designs.^[409][36]

   Fresnel lighthouse lenses are ranked by order, a measure of refracting
   power, with a first order lens being the largest, most powerful and
   expensive; and a sixth order lens being the smallest. The order is
   based on the focal length of the lens. A first order lens has the
   longest focal length, with the sixth being the shortest. Coastal
   lighthouses generally use first, second, or third order lenses, while
   harbor lights and beacons use fourth, fifth, or sixth order
   lenses.^[410][37]

   Some lighthouses, such as those at [411]Cape Race, Newfoundland, and
   [412]Makapuu Point, Hawaii, used a more powerful [413]hyperradiant
   Fresnel lens manufactured by the firm of [414]Chance Brothers.

Building

   [[415]edit]

Components

   [[416]edit]
   [417][250px-Lighthouse_lantern_room_with_Fresnel_lens.png] Lighthouse
   lantern room from mid-1800s

   While lighthouse buildings differ depending on the location and
   purpose, they tend to have common components.

   A light station comprises the lighthouse tower and all outbuildings,
   such as the keeper's living quarters, fuel house, boathouse, and
   [418]fog-signaling building. The Lighthouse itself consists of a tower
   structure supporting the lantern room where the light operates.

   The lantern room is the glassed-in housing at the top of a lighthouse
   tower containing the lamp and lens. Its glass storm panes are supported
   by metal [419]muntins (glazing bars) running vertically or diagonally.
   At the top of the lantern room is a stormproof ventilator designed to
   remove the smoke of the lamps and the heat that builds in the glass
   enclosure. A [420]lightning rod and grounding system connected to the
   metal cupola roof provides a safe conduit for any lightning strikes.

   Immediately beneath the lantern room is usually a Watch Room or Service
   Room where fuel and other supplies were kept and where the keeper
   prepared the lanterns for the night and often stood watch. The
   clockworks (for rotating the lenses) were also located there. On a
   lighthouse tower, an open platform called the gallery is often located
   outside the watch room (called the Main Gallery) or Lantern Room
   (Lantern Gallery). This was mainly used for cleaning the outside of the
   windows of the Lantern Room.^[421][38]

   Lighthouses near to each other that are similar in shape are often
   painted in a unique pattern so they can easily be recognized during
   daylight, a marking known as a [422]daymark. The black and white barber
   pole spiral pattern of [423]Cape Hatteras Lighthouse is one example.
   [424]Race Rocks Light in western Canada is painted in horizontal black
   and white bands to stand out against the horizon.

Design

   [[425]edit]

   For effectiveness, the lamp must be high enough to be seen before the
   danger is reached by a mariner. The minimum height is calculated by
   trigonometry (see [426]Distance to the horizon) as
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <mstyle
   displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"> <mi>D</mi> <mo>=</mo>
   <mn>1.22</mn> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <msqrt> <mi>H</mi>
   </msqrt> </mrow> </mstyle> </mrow> <annotation
   encoding="application/x-tex">{\displaystyle D=1.22{\sqrt
   {H}}}</annotation> </semantics> :MATH]
   {\displaystyle D=1.22{\sqrt {H}}} , where H is the height above water
   in feet, and D is the distance from the lighthouse to the horizon in
   nautical miles, the lighthouse range.^[427][39]

   Where dangerous shoals are located far off a flat sandy beach, the
   prototypical tall masonry coastal lighthouse is constructed to assist
   the navigator making a landfall after an ocean crossing. Often these
   are cylindrical to reduce the effect of wind on a tall structure, such
   as [428]Cape May Light. Smaller versions of this design are often used
   as harbor lights to mark the entrance into a harbor, such as [429]New
   London Harbor Light.

   Where a tall cliff exists, a smaller structure may be placed on top
   such as at [430]Horton Point Light. Sometimes, such a location can be
   too high, for example along the west coast of the United States, where
   frequent low clouds can obscure the light. In these cases, lighthouses
   are placed below the clifftop to ensure that they can still be seen at
   the surface during periods of fog or low clouds, as at [431]Point Reyes
   Lighthouse. Another example is in [432]San Diego, [433]California: the
   [434]Old Point Loma lighthouse was too high up and often obscured by
   fog, so it was replaced in 1891 with a lower lighthouse, [435]New Point
   Loma lighthouse.^[[436]This paragraph needs citation(s)]

   As technology advanced, prefabricated skeletal iron or steel structures
   tended to be used for lighthouses constructed in the 20th century.
   These often have a narrow cylindrical core surrounded by an open
   lattice work bracing, such as [437]Finns Point Range Light.

   Sometimes a lighthouse needs to be constructed in the water itself.
   Wave-washed lighthouses are masonry structures constructed to withstand
   water impact, such as [438]Eddystone Lighthouse in Britain and the
   [439]St. George Reef Light of California. In shallower bays,
   [440]Screw-pile lighthouse ironwork structures are screwed into the
   seabed and a low wooden structure is placed above the open framework,
   such as [441]Thomas Point Shoal Lighthouse. As screw piles can be
   disrupted by ice, steel caisson lighthouses such as [442]Orient Point
   Light are used in cold climates. [443]Orient Long Beach Bar Light (Bug
   Light) is a blend of a screw pile light that was converted to a caisson
   light because of the threat of ice damage.^[444][40] Skeletal iron
   towers with screw-pile foundations were built on the [445]Florida Reef
   along the Florida Keys, beginning with the [446]Carysfort Reef Light in
   1852.^[447][41]

   In waters too deep for a conventional structure, a [448]lightship might
   be used instead of a lighthouse, such as the former [449]lightship
   Columbia. Most of these have now been replaced by fixed light platforms
   (such as [450]Ambrose Light) similar to those used for offshore
   [451]oil exploration.^[452][37]

Range lights

   [[453]edit]
   Main article: [454]Range lights
   [455][250px-Margaree_Harbour_Range_Lights.jpg] Range Lights in
   [456]Margaree Harbour, Nova Scotia. When a vessel is on the correct
   course, the two lights align one above the other.

   Aligning two fixed points on land provides a navigator with a [457]line
   of position called a range in North America and a [458]transit in
   Britain. Ranges can be used to precisely align a vessel within a narrow
   channel such as a river. With landmarks of a range illuminated with a
   set of fixed lighthouses, nighttime navigation is possible.

   Such paired lighthouses are called [459]range lights in North America
   and [460]leading lights in the United Kingdom. The closer light is
   referred to as the beacon or front range; the further light is called
   the rear range. The rear range light is almost always taller than the
   front.

   When a vessel is on the correct course, the two lights align
   vertically, but when the observer is out of position, the difference in
   alignment indicates the direction of travel to correct the course.

Location

   [[461]edit]
   [462][250px-Faro_Les_%C3%89claireurs%2C_Ushuaia_11.JPG] The [463]Les
   Eclaireurs Lighthouse in [464]Ushuaia,

   located on a higher mound in
   India[468][250px-Europa_Point_Lighthouse.jpg] Lighthouse at [469]Europa
   Point, [470]Gibraltar

   There are two types of lighthouses: ones that are located on land, and
   ones that are offshore.

   Offshore Lighthouses are lighthouses that are not close to
   land.^[471][42] There can be a number of reasons for these lighthouses
   to be built. Offshore lighthouses are commonly used to project
   sovereignty or territorial assertions over maritime claims, often
   having manifested as early public services and state
   building.^[472][43] Examples of such lighthouses include the
   [473]Raffles Lighthouse which asserts Singapore's southern maritime
   claims, the [474]Subi Reef lighthouse which asserts the disputed
   Chinese claim over the South China Seas, and [475]Machias Seal Island
   lighthouse which affirms Canada's disputed claim in its boundary
   dispute with the United States of America in the Gulf of Maine and the
   Bay of Fundy. There can be a [476]shoal, [477]reef or submerged
   [478]island several miles from land.

   The current [479]Cordouan Lighthouse was completed in 1611, 7
   kilometres (4.3 mi) from the shore on a small islet, but was built on a
   previous lighthouse that can be traced back to the 880s and is the
   oldest surviving lighthouse in [480]France. It is connected to the
   mainland by a causeway. The oldest surviving oceanic offshore
   lighthouse is [481]Bell Rock Lighthouse in the [482]North Sea, off the
   coast of [483]Scotland.^[484][44]

Maintenance

   [[485]edit]
   See also: [486]Lighthouse keeper

Asia and Oceania

   [[487]edit]

   In [488]Australia, lighthouses are conducted by the [489]Australian
   Maritime Safety Authority.

   In [490]India, lighthouses are maintained by the Directorate General of
   Lighthouses and Lightships, an office of the [491]Ministry of Ports,
   Shipping and Waterways.^[492][45]

Europe

   [[493]edit]

   The former Soviet government built a number of automated lighthouses
   powered by [494]radioisotope thermoelectric generators in remote
   locations in northern Russia. They operated for long periods without
   external support with great reliability.^[495][46] However, numerous
   installations deteriorated, were stolen, or vandalized. Some cannot be
   found due to poor record-keeping.^[496][47]

   The [497]United Kingdom and the [498]Republic of Ireland together have
   three bodies: lighthouses around the coasts of England and Wales are
   looked after by [499]Trinity House, those around Scotland and the Isle
   of Man by the [500]Northern Lighthouse Board and those around Ireland
   by the [501]Commissioners of Irish Lights.

North America

   [[502]edit]

   In Canada, lighthouses are managed by the [503]Canadian Coast Guard.

   In the United States, lighthouses are maintained by the [504]United
   States Coast Guard, into which the [505]United States Lighthouse
   Service was merged in 1939.^[506][37]

Preservation

   [[507]edit]

   As lighthouses became less essential to navigation, many of their
   historic structures faced demolition or neglect. In the United States,
   the [508]National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000 provides
   for the transfer of lighthouse structures to local governments and
   private non-profit groups, while the USCG continues to maintain the
   lamps and lenses. In Canada, the [509]Nova Scotia Lighthouse
   Preservation Society won heritage status for [510]Sambro Island
   Lighthouse, and sponsored the [511]Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act
   to change Canadian federal laws to protect lighthouses.^[512][48]

   Many groups formed to restore and save lighthouses around the world,
   including the [513]World Lighthouse Society and the [514]United States
   Lighthouse Society,^[515][49] as well as the [516]Amateur Radio
   Lighthouse Society, which sends amateur radio operators to publicize
   the preservation of remote lighthouses throughout the world.^[517][50]
