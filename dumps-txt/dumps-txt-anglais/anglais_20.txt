   Photons are fundamental subatomic particles that carry the
   electromagnetic force — or, in simpler terms, they are light particles
   (and so much more). The photon is also the "quantum," or fundamental
   unit, of electromagnetic radiation. Everyone is surrounded by photons:
   The light coming from the screen you're viewing is composed of photons,
   the X-rays doctor use to see bones are made of photons, the radio in a
   car receives its signal from photons, and the magnets on a fridge use
   photons to hold themselves up.

   Like all other subatomic particles, photons exhibit wave-particle
   duality, meaning that sometimes they behave as tiny particles and
   sometimes they act as waves. Photons are massless, allowing them to
   travel at the speed of light in a vacuum (299,792,458 meters per
   second) and can travel an infinite distance.

Photon discovery

   Although physicists have studied the nature of light for centuries,
   arguments went back and forth as to whether light was made of tiny
   particles or was wave-like in nature. In the late 1800s, however, the
   pioneering work of German physicist Max Planck changed the entire
   picture.

   Planck was studying something called blackbody radiation, or light from
   a special device that emitted light at all frequencies as efficiently
   as possible. Until Planck, nobody could explain the spectrum of light
   coming from these devices, so Planck added a "fix" to the equations. By
   assuming that light could be emitted only in discrete chunks of energy,
   known as quanta, he was able to develop a formula that perfectly
   explained the blackbody spectra, according to HyperPhysics.

   Physicists weren't exactly sure what to make of Planck's result, but
   several years later, Albert Einstein took it one step further. To
   explain the photoelectric effect, which is the release of electrons
   from a metal when light shines on it, Einstein proposed that light
   itself is composed of discrete little chunks, according to the American
   Physical Society. Over time, those little chunks became known as
   photons.

   The work of Planck, Einstein and others to study the nature of light
   kick-started the development of quantum mechanics.

Are photons particles?

   Strictly speaking, photons are neither particles nor waves; they are a
   combination of both. In some situations, their particle-like nature
   comes out more, and in others, their wave-like nature is more apparent.

   For example, a detector can register the arrival of a single photon,
   which appears as a point-like particle. The process known as Compton
   scattering involves a photon striking an electron, and in that
   situation, the photon acts as a particle.

   However, it's impossible to predict exactly where or when a photon will
   strike a detector. In quantum mechanics, one can only assign
   probabilities to events. Those events are modeled by equations for
   waves, with peaks in the waves corresponding to regions of high
   probability of receiving a photon and troughs corresponding to regions
   of low probability, according to AccessScience by McGraw Hill.

   This concept is best exemplified by the famous double-slit experiment,
   which solidified the dual wave-particle nature of light (and,
   eventually, other subatomic particles). When light passes through a
   screen with two slits cut into it, it forms an interference pattern on
   the detector on the other side of the screen, where the peaks of waves
   line up with each other in some places, and where the peaks and troughs
   cancel each other out in others. Even though only one photon passes
   through the screen at a time — with each individual photon acting like
   a particle — the interference pattern that emerges on the detector is
   the exact same pattern that would occur if waves were passing through
   the slits instead.

Do photons have mass and momentum?

   Photons have zero mass, which allows them to travel at the fastest
   possible speed in the universe, the speed of light. However, they do
   have energy and momentum. The energy of a photon is given by Planck's
   constant times the frequency of the light, and the momentum of a photon
   is given by Planck's constant times the frequency of the light times
   the speed of light, according to the University of Calgary's Energy
   Education website.

   The fact that photons have momentum enables a broad array of
   applications. For example, solar sails are experimental propulsion
   devices that use sunlight to push a spacecraft. According to NASA, the
   photons from the sun bounce off of the reflecting sail, thus imparting
   their momentum on the sail and moving the spacecraft.

Do photons experience time?

   Our understanding of the rate of the passage of time comes from
   Einstein's theory of special relativity, which states that objects
   traveling closer and closer to the speed of light will experience
   slower and slower rates of the passage of time. In other words, moving
   clocks run slowly, according to John D. Horton of the University of
   Pittsburgh.

   However, the mathematics of special relativity apply only to objects
   traveling more slowly than the speed of light and don't apply directly
   to photons, which do travel at the speed of light. Thus, it's
   impossible to say what a photon "experiences" in terms of the flow of
   time, because scientists have no mathematical language to support it.
   Another way to put this is that the concept of the flow of time is
   meaningless to photons.

Are photons affected by gravity?

   Because photons have both energy and momentum, they are influenced by
   gravity. Under Einstein's theory of general relativity, which is our
   modern understanding of gravity, anything with any form of energy
   (including mass, momentum and torsion) is influenced by gravity.
   Specifically, massless particles, such as photons, follow "geodesics,"
   which are paths of minimum distance from one point to another,
   according to EarthSky.

   In general relativity, space-time is curved due to the influence of
   massive objects. This can make the "minimum distance" path a curved
   line, just as jets have to follow a curved path to go straight from one
   city to another, because Earth itself is curved.

   The curvature of space-time affects photons in several ways. When
   photons are moving from a region of strong gravity to a region of
   weaker gravity, they will lose energy, which lowers their frequencies
   to the redder end of the spectrum. When photons pass near massive
   objects, their direction of motion will change.
