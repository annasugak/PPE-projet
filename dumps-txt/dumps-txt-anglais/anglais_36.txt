   Innovation is at the core of architecture, expressed through new
   approaches to design, material experimentation, and, of course, ways of
   living. As a result, the conception of buildings and indoor spaces is
   constantly evolving. This evolution is especially evident in regions
   with a rich cultural heritage, such as Spain, where innovation
   reinterprets traditional ways of relating to space. This attentiveness
   to memory and daily life extends into interiors, where each
   intervention has the potential to actively reshape how people
   experience a space and open new possibilities for living and
   interaction.

   Asking questions is the first step toward challenging what we take for
   granted and opening up new possibilities for planning and building.
   These questions, valuable in themselves, gain new strength when shared
   and examined through different perspectives. As they intersect with the
   experiences of professionals and brands, they weave together viewpoints
   that enrich the discussion. Design fairs and events around the world
   have become spaces where these conversations gain momentum, fostering
   connections and encouraging collaborative dynamics. In this landscape,
   Colombia has emerged as a hub, serving as a platform that promotes
   architecture and design across Latin America and the Caribbean while
   bringing the region's voice to the global stage.

Healing Light: The Impact of "Liter of Light" on Community Well-Being

   Healing Light: The Impact of "Liter of Light" on Community Well-Being -
   Featured Image Cortesia de Litro de Luz

   Sometimes, the simplest solutions are the most revolutionary and
   impactful. During Brazil's energy crisis in 2002, mechanic Alfredo
   Moser developed an accessible and effective way to illuminate indoor
   spaces during the day. Using only a PET bottle installed on the roof,
   filled with water and bleach, he harnessed the refraction of sunlight
   to bring brightness to spaces previously immersed in darkness. In
   self-built homes, where successive extensions often compromise natural
   light and ventilation, this solution makes a significant difference.
   Named the "Moser lamp," the invention produces illumination equivalent
   to a 60W bulb and gained worldwide recognition through various reports.
   Since then, the project has continued to evolve and adapt to the needs
   of modern communities, transforming lives through a solution that is as
   simple as it is highly intelligent.

Art, Activism, and the City: Illuminating Social Change

   March 13, 2025

   The creative fusion of art and activism in urban spaces has propelled
   the British collective Led by Donkeys into the spotlight, garnering
   millions of views for their interventions on social media. Their
   critical visual occupations - whether billboard messages during the day
   or large-scale projections at night - raise a compelling question:
   which medium holds the greater persuasive power? The book "Led by
   Donkeys: Adventures in Art, Activism and Accountability" offers a deep
   dive into their conceptual approach, charting their rapid evolution
   over six years. What began as a London-based response to Brexit has
   expanded into a global critique of political hypocrisy, addressing
   issues in Europe, the Middle East, and America. For Peter Weibel,
   former director of the ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe,
   Germany, the innovative fusion of activism and art—or
   "Artivism"—represents the first new art form of the 21st century. Years
   of experience in environmental activism provided the group with crucial
   insights into the mechanics of political communication, the
   organization of public interventions, and the challenges of achieving
   meaningful societal change.

Shaping Atmospheres with Lighting: A Human-Centered Approach to Emotional
Design

   Emotional Design - Featured Image Courtesy of Vibia

   When designing and lighting a space, is the goal to fulfill a specific
   requirement or to be creative? Both perspectives hold merit; however, a
   unifying principle should always prevail: people must remain at the
   center of everything we do. Today, it is well understood that our
   environment significantly influences our well-being, affecting mood and
   performance, even in challenging contexts such as outer space. While
   this standpoint has encompassed anthropometric and biological aspects,
   new approaches are expanding design beyond the tangible. Lighting is
   now used to shape atmospheres that resonate deeply with our emotions.

Light Above: A Bright Take on Architecture

   Light Above: A Bright Take on Architecture - Featured Image Scarborough

   The Pantheon in Rome is a true architectural masterpiece and holds the
   title of the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world. Among its
   most remarkable elements is the central oculus — an 8.2-meter-wide
   opening at the top of the dome that allows natural light to enter. This
   creates a dynamic play of light and shadow that shifts throughout the
   day, enhancing the grandeur of the structure. Beyond its practical
   function, the oculus establishes a symbolic connection between the
   earthly and the divine, reflecting the Pantheon's original purpose as a
   temple dedicated to all gods. In fact, toplighting, which introduces
   natural light from above through skylights, domes, or other upper
   openings, contrasts with traditional windows, which capture light
   horizontally. By capturing direct sunlight, toplighting provides soft,
   diffuse illumination, creating more welcoming environments with better
   energy efficiency and a positive impact on mood and productivity.

Smart and Retro: Advanced Toggle Switches Harmonized with Le Corbusier's
Color System

   Corbusier's Color System - Featured Image LS 1912 toggle switches.

   Barragán, Bofill, Graves, and Le Corbusier are architects renowned for
   their exceptional and sensitive use of color. In their approaches,
   color takes on an importance comparable almost to functionality,
   achieved through a nuanced and comprehensive perception of their
   context. But what is color? From a technical standpoint, it is a visual
   perception that arises from the interaction of light with our eyes and
   brain. However, when we explore its meaning on a more emotional and
   poetic level, it takes on a deeper significance. For Ricardo Bofill,
   color infuses life into architecture, while for Charles-Édouard
   Jeanneret, —better known as Le Corbusier—, it serves as a powerful tool
   to evoke emotions and create spatial illusions.

   In 'Polychromie Architecturale' Le Corbusier argues that color is not
   only a decorative element but also a fundamental tool for creating
   environments and enhancing the functionality of architectural spaces.
   This idea, developed between 1931 and 1959, is articulated around a
   system composed of a range of colors, where each tone has its relevance
   and contributes to creating atmospheres that transcend mere
   architectural design. An example is JUNG's LS 1912 toggle switch range,
   which combines classic design with advanced control options and
   showcases the diverse hue variants of the 63 colors in Le Corbusier's
   color system.

   From subtle light beams to wide openings, skylights transform natural
   light into a powerful architectural tool, creating a dynamic interplay
   of light and shadow that adds movement and vitality to buildings. This
   intricate dance captivates not only with the patterns the light casts
   on surfaces but also with the practical benefits of overhead lighting,
   such as improved thermal comfort and enhanced well-being.

   Walls have long been more than mere structural elements; they are
   canvases that narrate stories, reflecting desires for nature,
   spirituality, or the pursuit of tranquility and stimulation. With
   advancements in addressable LED pixels, walls have evolved into
   immersive digital surfaces capable of displaying any image in large
   format, adapting to the needs of the moment.

   However, while universities continue to train architects and interior
   designers to create static buildings, the art of meaningful
   storytelling through digital screens—especially those with
   dynamics—remains largely unexplored in academic curricula.

   Mayer

   Over the years, the nocturnal landscape of cities has witnessed a
   significant transformation, marked by the emergence of more than
   80-night mayors globally, a trend that has been on the rise since the
   early 2000s. Andreina Seijas, currently working as an Associate at
   Gehl, has analyzed these shifting dynamics of night-time governance in
   her research and during her doctoral studies at Harvard GSD. Seijas
   speaks in the interview about this development, challenges, and
   opportunities with night mayors, global differences, and the role of
   climate change. Seijas' upbringing in Caracas, Venezuela, where safety
   concerns dictated strict curfews, ignited her passion for creating
   safer, more inclusive urban environments, particularly for the youth.
   Her quest for a better future for the urban night explores the
   potential for cities to become safer, more inclusive, and more
   productive by creating spaces for work and leisure after dark.

   When we think of the word "tropic," the image that typically comes to
   mind is an exotic space, characterized by perpetual warmth and
   humidity, with frequent and heavy rainfall nurturing lush vegetation.
   Throughout history, this tropical climate has been romanticized as a
   paradise and criticized for potentially fostering weakness due to its
   perceived clemency.

   Thankfully, those judgments and associations have been relegated to the
   past, paving the way for theoretical and practical projects that
   outline the advantages and disadvantages of living in a tropical
   climate. These projects acknowledge the various strategies to enhance
   human adaptability within these distinctive climatic conditions.

   Design - Featured Image Cortesia de Vibia

   Flat and polished surfaces tend to evoke feelings of coldness and
   sterility, while raw, natural materials can create a sense of warmth
   and connection. Textures can trigger memories and emotions, connecting
   us to past experiences and the sense of touch. In the seminal book "The
   Eyes of the Skin", Juhani Pallasmaa emphasizes the importance of
   sensory perception in architecture and objects beyond sight,
   particularly the role of touch and texture in shaping our experience.
   According to Pallasmaa, contemporary culture, influenced by technology
   and visual media, has overemphasized the visual aspect of spaces,
   neglecting other senses, especially touch, which is vital for
   understanding and appreciating the surrounding environment.
