Gaslighting

   [121]Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff

   Gaslighting is an insidious form of manipulation and psychological
   control. Victims of gaslighting are deliberately and systematically fed
   false information that leads them to question what they know to be
   true, often about themselves. They may end up doubting their
   [122]memory, their perception, and even their sanity. Over time, a
   gaslighter’s manipulations can grow more complex and potent, making it
   increasingly difficult for the victim to see the truth.

How Gaslighting Works

   fizkes/Shutterstock

   [126]The term gaslighting comes from a 1938 play, Gas Light, and its
   film adaptation. Gaslighting can occur in personal or professional
   relationships, and victims are targeted at the core of their being:
   their sense of [127]identity and [128]self-worth. Manipulative people
   who engage in gaslighting do so to attain power over their victims,
   either because they simply derive warped enjoyment from the act or
   because they wish to emotionally, physically or financially control
   their victim.
   How does gaslighting begin?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   A relationship with a gaslighter may seem to start out quite well. They
   may praise their target on a first date and immediately confide in
   them. Such disclosure, before any [129]intimacy has been established,
   establishes trust quickly; it’s part of [130]a tactic known as love
   bombing. The more quickly a victim becomes enamored, the more quickly
   the next phase of manipulation can begin.
   What are a gaslighter’s tactics?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   A gaslighter will initially lie about simple things, but [131]the
   volume of misinformation soon grows, and the gaslighter may accuse the
   victim of [132]lying if he or she questions the narrative. They
   typically deploy occasional positive reinforcement to confuse the
   victim and keep them off balance, but at the same time, they may
   attempt to turn others against the victim, even their own friends and
   family, by telling them that the victim has been lying or is
   delusional.
   How do you know that you're being gaslighted?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   Self-doubt may rise as the gaslighter insists that what the victim
   remembers, thinks, and feels is wrong. The manipulative individual may
   then introduce lies in more sensitive arenas, aiming to disrupt and
   distort foundational aspects of the victim’s being, wearing them down,
   establishing confusion, and [133]forcing them to rely on the
   gaslighter’s version of reality.
   Is gaslighting ever unintentional?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   It is possible for an individual to manipulate someone without
   realizing they are doing so. Importantly, though, the person still
   enjoys wielding control over the mind and behavior of the victim, even
   if they [134]cannot articulate or acknowledge it. Some people engage in
   manipulative behavior because they witnessed it frequently as a child,
   most often in their parents. Regardless of a gaslighter's level of
   self-awareness, though, the behavior is never acceptable, and ignorance
   of its manipulative effects should not be accepted as an excuse.
   What is medical gaslighting?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   Medical gaslighting refers to a scenario in which a medical provider
   [135]ignores or downplays an individual's legitimate medical concerns.
   This is a colloquial use of the term "gaslighting" and often refers to
   situations in which a medical provider may not actually intend to
   mislead or manipulate a patient; rather, they failed to take the
   patient's concerns seriously or to pursue them in an attempt to reach a
   diagnosis.

How to Recognize a Gaslighter

   Olena Yakobchuk/Shutterstock

   Gaslighting can be more effective and successful than many people
   imagine, and almost anyone can be susceptible to gaslighting tactics,
   which have been deployed throughout history, and continue to be used
   today, by domestic abusers, dictators, narcissists, and cult leaders.
   The most effective gaslighters are often the hardest to detect; they
   may be better recognized by their victims' actions and mental state.
   Who becomes a gaslighter?

   Those who employ this tactic often have a [136]personality
   disorder—[137]narcissistic [138]personality disorder and
   [139]psychopathy chief among them. Manipulators have a tendency to
   present one face to their target and another to the rest of the world,
   leading victims to assume that if they ask for help or speak out, no
   one will believe that they have been emotionally abused. Gaslighters
   typically repeat their tactics across several relationships.


   What’s the difference between gaslighting and manipulation?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   Manipulation is a key part of gaslighting, but manipulation is a fairly
   common tactic that almost anyone is capable of employing, while
   gaslighting, and gaslighters, are more rare. Children, for example, try
   to manipulate parents at an early age, and marketers aim to manipulate
   consumers, but gaslighting involves a pattern of abusive behaviors with
   the intent not just to influence someone, but actually to control them.
   What’s the difference between gaslighting and narcissism?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   A narcissist may be self-promoting and feel superior to others; a
   gaslighter aims to make another person question their own self-value.
   Gaslighting can sometimes be a tactic employed by someone with a
   [140]narcissistic [141]personality, but it is not a core trait of
   narcissistic [142]personality disorder.

Leaving a Gaslighter

   wavebreakmedia/Shuterstock

   A primary goal of a gaslighter is to keep their victim hooked. If a
   victim disagrees with or questions the abuser, he or she may try to
   make it seem as if they themselves are being victimized by the target.
   Alternately, they may try to lure a reluctant partner back to them
   through positive reinforcement. Many people eventually find a way to
   escape a gaslighter’s influence, leaving the manipulator to search for
   a new victim; often, research suggests, they already have a target in
   mind.
   What is “hoovering”?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   When someone tries to leave them, a gaslighter may turn to the tactic
   of  "hoovering," which takes its name from the vacuum-cleaner brand. A
   hoovering gaslighter will tell the victim how much they love him or
   her, and praise all of their positive qualities. They may also explain
   how things are going to change between them. But soon after the victim
   agrees to stay, things tend to go back to the way they were.

   Gaslighting can be psychologically devastating. It violates trust and
   upends an individual’s view that people are generally good, potentially
   making them suspicious of everyone close to them. Falling victim to a
   gaslighter also [143]erodes a person’s trust in themselves and makes
   them forget what they once valued about themselves; after all, it’s
   easy to blame themselves for having been too trusting, vulnerable, or
   dependent. The experience makes some victims never want to be part of a
   relationship again.
