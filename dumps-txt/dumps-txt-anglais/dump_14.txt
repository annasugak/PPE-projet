A Bright Light at the End of the Tunnel? Study Finds Even Dying Brains May Be
'Conscious'

   Written by Kaitlin Vogel on May 5, 2023 — Fact checked by Jill
   Seladi-Schulman, Ph.D.

     * A new study showed a surge of brain activity associated with
       consciousness among comatose patients who died after cardiac
       arrest.
     * The activity was found in the part of the brain linked to dreaming,
       visual hallucinations in epilepsy and altered states of
       consciousness.
     * Overall, further research is needed to better understand more about
       what happens in the dying brain.

   There have been many theories and questions that go unanswered
   regarding what happens when a person dies. Some people who have had
   near-death experiences reported seeing a white light while others have
   said they floated above their bodies and saw themselves below.

   New research uncovered interesting brain wave patterns in comatose
   patients who died after[111] cardiac arrest. The [112]study, published
   this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, showed
   a surge of conscious-like activity in the dying brain.

   Understanding why the brain is activated during the dying process

   Researchers examined four patients under EEG monitoring who passed away
   due to cardiac arrest. Since the patients were unresponsive, comatose
   and couldn’t receive any further medical help, they were taken off life
   support.

   After being taken off the ventilator, two patients showed an increase
   in heart rate and a surge of gamma wave activity in the brain, which is
   the fastest type of activity and is also correlated with consciousness.

   Additionally, the activity was found in the part of the brain
   associated with dreaming, visual [113]hallucinations in [114]epilepsy,
   and altered states of consciousness.

   [115]Jimo Borjigin, Ph.D., associate professor in the Department of
   Molecular & Integrative Physiology and the Department of Neurology at
   the University of Michigan and one of the authors of the study
   explained the main takeaways of the reserach.

   “First, the brain can be activated by the dying process,” Borjigin told
   Healthline. “Second, we need to investigate the role of the brain in
   cardiac arrest: if the brain is more activated during dying, why? There
   are functions of the brain we did not know prior to our study.”

   Trying to understand what happens as we die

   “We don’t fully know the answer to this question,” said [116]Dr. Andrew
   Newberg, neuroscientist and director of research at the Marcus
   Institute of Integrative Health and a physician at Jefferson University
   Hospital. “Previously, it was assumed that the brain just stops
   functioning, but this study, and several other similar ones, are
   suggesting that there is specific brain activity associated with the
   near-death state.”

   The study found that areas of the brain associated with cognitive
   processes, including the temporo-parietal junction and the prefrontal
   cortex, were involved.

   Newberg added that these areas of the brain have been [117]associated
   with spiritual experiences and that these experiences are associated
   with an increased activity in the [118]sympathetic nervous system,
   which controls the “fight-or-flight” response in the body.

   Do people see a light at the end of the tunnel?

   “What this study really suggests is that the brain is undergoing some
   chemical changes during the dying process. It explains the perceptions
   people have about seeing angels or light at the end of a tunnel,”
   [119]Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at NYU Langone Medical Center,
   stated. “What it shows is that the brain has measures that it takes to
   try and wake itself up and fires off in ways that can be
   hallucinatory.”

   Many people are curious about what happens next after death, but this
   study is very preliminary and doesn’t go down that road.

   “In some ways, this study sheds light on people’s fear that maybe
   they’re going to suffer when they’re dying at the last moment, and that
   doesn’t seem to be the case. But maybe they’ll be disappointed because
   what this study is suggesting is you don’t get any insights from the
   dying experience into what really comes next,” Caplan added.

   Takeaway

   According to a new study, a surge of conscious-like brain activity
   occurred among comatose patients who died after cardiac arrest.

   The activity was found in the part of the brain associated with
   dreaming, visual hallucinations in epilepsy and altered states of
   consciousness.

   Experts are hopeful that continuing with this line of study and
   learning more about the dying brain could save cardiac arrest patients
   in the future.
