   Hello! I am the AI search assistant, here to help you use OED’s
   advanced search tools. I can't converse or generate answers myself, but
   I can construct complex searches on your behalf and provide a link to
   the results. I can also help you find information about the OED itself.
   If you are interested in looking up a particular word, the best way to
   do that is to use the search box at the top of every OED page.

   Example queries I can run are "Which words in English are borrowed from
   French?", "Which words were first used by Charles Dickens?" or "How are
   words added to the dictionary?".

   I cannot search for synonyms yet, but I’m ready to help with other
   advanced searches. Give me a try!
