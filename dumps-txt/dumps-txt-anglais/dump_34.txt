   [181][250px-Modern_British_LED_Traffic_Light.jpg] An LED 50-[182]watt
   traffic light in [183]Portsmouth, United Kingdom

   Traffic lights, traffic signals, or stoplights – also known as robots
   in [184]South Africa,^[185][1]^[186][2] [187]Zambia, and [188]Namibia –
   are signalling devices positioned at [189]road intersections,
   [190]pedestrian crossings, and other locations in order to control the
   flow of [191]traffic.^[192][3]

   Traffic lights usually consist of three signals, transmitting
   meaningful information to road users through colours and symbols,
   including arrows and bicycles. The usual traffic light colours are red
   to stop traffic, [193]amber for traffic change, and green to allow
   traffic to proceed. These are arranged vertically or horizontally in
   that order. Although this is internationally standardised,^[194][4]
   variations in traffic light sequences and laws exist on national and
   local scales.^[195][5]

   Traffic lights were first introduced in December 1868 on
   [196]Parliament Square in [197]London to reduce the need for police
   officers to control traffic.^[198][6] Since then, electricity and
   computerised control have advanced traffic light technology and
   increased intersection capacity.^[199][7] The system is also used for
   other purposes, including the control of pedestrian movements, variable
   lane control (such as [200]tidal flow systems or [201]smart motorways),
   and railway [202]level crossings.

History

   [[203]edit]
   Main article: [204]History of traffic lights

   In December 1868, the first traffic signals showing a red or green
   light at night were installed outside the [205]Houses of Parliament in
   London.^[206][8] A police constable raised or lowered the semaphore
   arms and, at night, operated a lever to control the lights which
   drivers and pedestrians saw.^[207][9] This system exploded on 2 January
   1869 and was taken down. This early traffic signal led to other parts
   of the world implementing similar traffic signal systems. In the first
   two decades of the 20th century, semaphore traffic signals like the one
   in London were in use all over the United States. These traffic signals
   were controlled by a [208]traffic officer who changed the commands on
   the signal to direct traffic.^[209][10]

   In 1912, the first electric traffic light was developed by [210]Lester
   Wire, a policeman in [211]Salt Lake City, [212]Utah.^[213][11] In
   August 1914, it was installed by the American Traffic Signal Company on
   the corner of East 105th Street and [214]Euclid Avenue in
   [215]Cleveland, Ohio.^[216][12]^[217][13]^[218][14] In 1920, the first
   four-way, three-colour traffic light was created by [219]William Potts
   in [220]Detroit, Michigan.^[221][15] His design was the first to
   include an amber 'caution' light along with red and green
   lights.^[222][16] Potts was Superintendent of Signals for the Police
   Department of Detroit. In 1921, he installed automatic four-way,
   three-colour traffic lights in 15 towers across
   Detroit.^[223][17]^[224][16]^[225][15]

   By 1922, traffic towers were beginning to be controlled by automatic
   timers more widely. The main advantage of the use of the timer was that
   it saved cities money by replacing traffic officers. [226]New York City
   was able to reassign all but 500 of its 6,000 officers working on the
   traffic squad, saving the city $12,500,000.^[227][18] In 1923,
   [228]Garrett Morgan patented a design of a manually operated three-way
   traffic light with moving arms.^[229][19]

   The control of traffic lights changed with the rise of computers in
   America in the 1950s. One of the best historical examples of
   computerised control of lights was in [230]Denver, Colorado in 1952. In
   1967, [231]Toronto, Canada was the first to use more advanced computers
   that were better at vehicle detection.^[232][7] The computers
   maintained control over 159 signals in Toronto through telephone
   lines.^[233][20]

Vehicular signals

   [[234]edit]
   [235][250px-Traffic_lights.jpg] Traffic lights can have several
   additional lights for filter turns or bus lanes.Road crossing of
   [236]A970 with [237]Sumburgh Airport's runway in [238]Shetland. The
   movable barrier closes when an aircraft lands or takes off.

   in Japan

   A set of lights, known as a signal head,^[240][21]^: 3.2.4  may have
   one, two, three, or more aspects. The most common signal type has three
   aspects facing the oncoming traffic: red on top, amber (yellow) below,
   and green below that. Additional aspects may be fitted to the signal,
   usually to indicate specific restrictions or filter movements.

Meanings of signals

   [[241]edit]

   The [242]1968 Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals Chapter III
   provides international standards for the setup of traffic signal
   operations. Not all states have ratified the convention. A three-colour
   signal head should have three non-flashing lights which are red,
   [243]amber, and green, arranged either horizontally (on the side
   opposite to the direction of traffic)^[[244]clarification needed] or
   vertically (with red on top). A two-colour signal head may be used in
   temporary operation and consists of red and green non-flashing lights.
   In both cases, all lights should be circular or arrow-shaped.^[245][4]
   Permissible signals for regulating vehicle traffic (other than public
   transport vehicles) are outlined in Article 23:^[246][4]

   CAPTION: Standard meanings for traffic lights internationally (Vienna
   Convention, Article 23)

   Light type Meaning
   Non-flashing Red Traffic may not proceed beyond the stop line, or
   otherwise enter the intersection.
   Red/Amber The signal is about to change, but the red light rule
   continues to apply.
   [247]Amber Traffic may not pass the stop line or enter the
   intersection, unless it cannot safely stop when the light shows.
   Green Traffic may proceed, unless it would not clear the intersection
   before the next change of phase.
   Flashing Red Traffic must not pass the stop line at a level crossing,
   approach to swing bridge or ferry landing stages, emergency vehicles
   entering the road, or on the approach to low-flying aircraft. In
   addition, to attract attention in these locations, it is also equipped
   with additional alarms and voice prompts.
   Amber Traffic may proceed but with caution.

   Green arrows are added to signals to indicate that traffic can proceed
   in a particular direction while the main lights for that approach are
   red, or that traffic can only proceed in one particular direction.
   Alternatively, when combined with another green signal, they may
   indicate that turning traffic has priority over oncoming traffic (known
   as a "filter arrow").^[248][21]^: 3.5  Flashing amber arrows typically
   indicate that road users must give way (to other drivers and
   pedestrians) before making a movement in the direction of the arrow.
   These are used because they are safer, cause less delay, and are more
   flexible. Flashing amber arrows will normally be located below the
   solid amber.^[249][22]

Green arrows

   [[250]edit]

   Arrow aspects may be used to permit certain movements or convey other
   messages to road users. A green arrow may display to require drivers to
   turn in a particular direction only or to allow drivers to continue in
   a particular direction when the signal is red.^[251][21]^: 3.5 
   Generally, a green phase is illuminated at the beginning of the green
   phase (a "leading turn") or at the end of the green phase (a "lagging
   turn").^[[252]citation needed] An 'indicative arrow' may be displayed
   alongside a green light. This indicates to drivers that oncoming
   traffic is stopped, such that they do not need to give way to that
   traffic when turning across it. As right-turning traffic (left-side
   drive) or left-turning traffic (right-side drive) does not normally
   have priority, this arrow is used to allow turning traffic to clear
   before the next phase begins.^[253][21]^: 3.5 

   Some variations of this setup exist. One version is a horizontal bar
   with five lights – the green and amber arrows are located between the
   standard green and amber lights. A vertical five-light bar holds the
   arrows underneath the standard green light. In this arrangement, the
   amber arrow is sometimes omitted, leaving only the green arrow below
   the steady green light, or possibly an [254]LED-based device capable of
   showing both green and amber arrows within a single lamp
   housing.^[255][23]

   A third type is known as a "doghouse" or "cluster head" – a vertical
   column with the two normal lights is on the right side of the signal, a
   vertical column with the two arrows is located on the left, and the
   normal red signal is in the middle above the two columns. Cluster
   signals in Australia and [256]New Zealand use six signals, the sixth
   being a red arrow that can operate separately from the standard red
   light.^[[257]citation needed]

   In a fourth type, sometimes seen at intersections in [258]Ontario and
   [259]Quebec, Canada, there is no dedicated left-turn lamp per
   se.^[260][24]^[261][25] Instead, the normal green lamp flashes rapidly,
   indicating permission to go straight as well as make a left turn in
   front of opposing traffic, which is being held by a steady red lamp.
   This "advance green", or flashing green can be somewhat startling and
   confusing to drivers not familiar with this system. This can cause
   confusion amongst visitors to British Columbia, where a flashing green
   signal denotes a pedestrian-controlled crosswalk.^[262][26] For this
   reason, Ontario is phasing out the use of flashing green signals and
   instead replacing them with arrows.^[263][27]^[264][28]

Countdown lights

   [[265]edit]

   Popular in Vietnam and China, countdown lights are additional lights
   installed next to, or above or below, the main signal lights. The
   countdown light is displayed by a countdown number with different
   colours, usually red, yellow, green, matching the colour of the light
   on. When the light counts to "0" (or 1), the main light colour
   immediately changes.

   Countdown lights may have zeros in the tens or none, some countdown
   lights may flash when getting ready to zero. Yellow lights can have
   countdown lights, but most lights do not. Usually the countdown light
   has 2 digits, in case the time of the main light (usually the red
   light, rarely the green light) is longer than 100 seconds, depending on
   the type of light, the following possibilities may occur:
    1. Lights have not counted down, when 99 seconds are left, start
       counting. During the standby time, the light may be displayed as
       "99", "00", "--" or not displayed.
    2. Last 2 digits count light of the timeout (the counter light is 15
       while the time is 115 seconds, there are some types of lights that
       count as "-9" or "9-" when the time is 109 seconds)
    3. Tens digit on the displayer becomes a letter. Displaying A0 for 100
       seconds, B0 for 110 seconds, so forth.
    4. Displaying only last 2 digits but with flashing to indicate it's
       more than 100.

   [266][250px-CountDownTrafficLight.gif] A countdown light

   Countdown lights are also used for both vehicular and pedestrian
   signals in the [267]Philippines. However, since 2025, the use of
   countdown timers have been phased out in [268]Metro Manila by the
   [269]Metropolitan Manila Development Authority to adopt a volume-based
   traffic signalling system. As a result, instead a countdown timer that
   will count down to the next phase, green signals will blink five times
   before turning to yellow.^[270][29]

Issue about yellow light dilemma zone in South Korea

   [[271]edit]

   In South Korea, the yellow (amber) light dilemma zone is not legally
   recognised. In other words, when the amber light is on, traffic may not
   pass the stop line or enter the intersection, even if the traffic
   cannot safely stop when the light shows.

   In May 2024, this was reaffirmed by the [272]Supreme Court of Korea
   ,^[273][30]^[274][31] for a case where the driver was speeding at
   62 km/h in a street limited up to 40 km/h, 55 % higher than the allowed
   speed.^[275][32]^[[276]unreliable source?]

   Criticism in South Korea says that this is unrealistic and
   unreasonable. This can cause multiple collisions due to sudden braking.

   In 2016, when speed limit was up to 60 km/h, proposed alternatives to
   this kind of collision were only roundabouts, speed compliance increase
   and speed practice reduction or elderly zones are also proposed
   solutions.^[277][33]

Yellow trap

   [[278]edit]

   Without an all-red phase, cross-turning traffic may be caught in a
   '[279]yellow trap'. When the signal turns yellow (amber), a turning
   driver may assume oncoming traffic will stop and a crash may result.
   For this reason, the US bans sequences that may cause a yellow
   trap.^[280][34] This can also happen when emergency vehicles or
   railroads preempt normal signal operation. ^[281][35] In the United
   States, signs reading "Oncoming traffic has extended green" or
   "Oncoming traffic may have extended green" must be posted at
   intersections where the "yellow trap" condition
   exists.^[282][36]^[283][37]

Variations

   [[284]edit]
   Main article: [285]Variations in traffic light operation

   The United States is not party to the [286]Vienna Convention; rather,
   the [287]Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) outlines
   correct operation in that country. In the US, a single signal head may
   have three, four, or five aspects. A single aspect green arrow may be
   displayed to indicate a continuous movement. The signals must be
   arranged red, amber, and green vertically (top to bottom) or
   horizontally (left to right).^[288][38] In the US, a single-aspect
   flashing amber signal can be used to raise attention to a warning sign
   and a single-aspect flashing red signal can be used to raise attention
   to a "stop", "do not enter", or "wrong way" sign.^[289][38] Flashing
   red or amber lights, known as intersection control beacons, are used to
   reinforce stop signs at intersections.^[290][39] The MUTCD specifies
   the following vehicular signals:^[291][38]

   In the Canadian province of [302]Quebec and the Maritime provinces,
   lights are often arranged horizontally, but each aspect is a different
   shape: red is a square (larger than the normal circle) and usually in
   pairs at either end of the fixture, amber is a diamond, and green is a
   circle. In many southern and southwestern U.S. states, most traffic
   signals are similarly horizontal in order to ease wind resistance
   during storms and hurricanes.^[303][40]

   Japanese traffic signals mostly follow the same rule except that the
   green "go" signals are referred to as 青 (ao), typically translated as
   "blue", reflecting [304]a historical change in the Japanese language.
   As a result, Japanese officials decreed in 1973 that the "go" light
   should be changed to the bluest possible shade of green, bringing the
   name more in line with the colour without violating the international
   "green means go" rule.^[305][41]

   In the UK, normal traffic lights follow this sequence:^[306][42]
     * Red – Stop, do not proceed.
     * Red and amber – Get ready to proceed, but do not proceed yet.
     * Green – Proceed if the intersection or crossing is clear; vehicles
       are not allowed to block the intersection or crossing.
     * Amber – Stop, unless it is unsafe to do so.

   A speed sign is a special traffic light, variable [307]traffic sign, or
   [308]variable-message sign giving drivers a recommended speed to
   approach the next traffic light in its green phase^[309][43] and avoid
   a stop due to reaching the intersection when lights are
   red.^[310][44]^[311][a]

Pedestrian signals

   [[312]edit]
   Further information: [313]Pedestrian crossing

   Pedestrian signals are used to inform pedestrians when to cross a road.
   Most pedestrian signal heads will have two lights: a 'walk' light
   (normally a walking human figure, typically coloured green or white)
   and a 'don't walk' light (normally either a red or orange man figure or
   a hand), though other variations exist.^[314][45]

   and the pedestrian signals are in combination with those controlling
   vehicular traffic.

   The [326]U.S. state of Massachusetts allows an unusual indication
   variation for pedestrian movement. At signalised intersections without
   separate pedestrian signal heads, the traffic signals may be programmed
   to turn red in all directions, followed by a [327]steady display of
   amber lights simultaneously with the red indications. During this
   red-plus-amber indication, the intersection is closed to vehicular
   traffic and pedestrians may cross, usually in whatever direction they
   choose.

   Where pedestrians need to cross the road between junctions, a
   signal-controlled crossing may be provided as an alternative to a
   [331]zebra crossing or uncontrolled crossing. Traffic lights are
   normally used at crossings where vehicle speeds are high, where either
   vehicle or pedestrian flows are high or near signalised
   junctions.^[332][21]^: c.18  In the UK, this type of crossing is called
   a [333]pelican crossing. More modern iterations are puffin and pedex
   crossings. In the UK, these crossings normally need at least four
   traffic signals, which are of a regular type (red, amber, and green),
   two facing in each direction. Pedestrians are provided with push
   buttons and pedestrian signals, consisting of a red and green man.
   Farside signals are located across the crossing, while nearside signals
   are located below the traffic lights, facing in the direction of
   oncoming traffic.^[334][21]^: c.18 

   A [335]HAWK beacon is a special type of traffic used in the US at
   mid-block crossings. These consist of two red signals above a single
   amber signal. The beacon is unlit until a pedestrian pushes the cross
   button. Then an amber light will show, followed by both red lights, at
   which point the 'Walk' symbol will illuminate for pedestrians. At the
   end of the crossing phase, the 'Don't Walk' symbol will flash, as will
   the amber traffic light.^[336][51]
   [337][250px-Shibuya_Crossing_%2825790725888%29.jpg] The [338]Shibuya
   Crossing, in Tokyo, is a famous example of a [339]pedestrian scramble
   with diagonal crossings.

   Pedestrians are usually incorporated into urban signalised junctions in
   one of four ways: no facilities, parallel walk, walk with traffic, or
   all-red stages. No facilities may be provided if pedestrian demand is
   low, in areas where pedestrians are not permitted, or if there is a
   subway or overpass. No provision of formal facilities means pedestrians
   will have to self-evaluate when it is safe to cross, which can be
   intimidating for pedestrians.^[340][21]^: 71 

   With a "parallel walk" design, pedestrians walk alongside the traffic
   flow. A [341]leading pedestrian interval may be provided, whereby
   pedestrians get a "walk" signal before the traffic gets a green light,
   allowing pedestrians to establish themselves on the crossing before
   vehicles begin to turn, to encourage drivers to give way.^[342][52]

   A 'walk with traffic' facility allows pedestrians to go at the same
   time as other traffic movements with no conflict between movements.
   This can work well on one-way roads, where turning movements are banned
   or where the straight-ahead movement runs in a different stage from the
   turning movement. A splitter island could also be provided. Traffic
   will pass on either side of the island and pedestrians can cross the
   road safely between the other flows.^[343][21]^: 72 

   An all-red stage, also known as a full pedestrian stage, a
   [344]pedestrian scramble or a Barnes Dance,^[345][b] holds all
   vehicular traffic at the junction to allow pedestrians time to safely
   cross without conflict from vehicles. It allows the use of diagonal
   crossings. This may require a longer cycle time and increase pedestrian
   wait periods, though the latter can be eased by providing two
   pedestrian stages.^[346][21]^: 71–72 
   [347][250px-MUTCD_Ped_Signal_-_Flashing_hand_with_timer.svg.png] A
   diagram of a countdown timer in the US style

   Pedestrian countdown timers are becoming common at urban
   signal-controlled crossings. Where a pedestrian countdown is shown, it
   is normally used in conjunction with the flashing hand signal (in the
   US and Canada) or blackout period (UK), showing the amount of time
   remaining in seconds until the end of the flashing hand or
   blackout.^[348][21]^[349][53] Pedestrian countdown timers do not
   significantly increase or reduce the number of red- and amber-light
   running drivers. Studies have found that pedestrian countdown timers do
   significantly improve pedestrian compliance over traditional pedestrian
   signals; however, results are mixed.^[350][53]^[351][54]

Smartphone Zombie ribbon

   [[352]edit]

   As 12 to 45% of pedestrian deaths caused by 'pedestrian distraction'
   have been linked to cell phone usage,^[353][55] some cities (including
   [354]Sydney, [355]Seoul, [356]Augsburg, [357]Bodegraven, [358]Tel Aviv,
   and [359]Singapore) have installed LED strips embedded in the sidewalk
   before crosswalks to warn distracted pedestrians of imminent pedestrian
   crossings.^[360][56] This additional signal, which is synchronised with
   conventional signals, aims to decrease injury rates by telling
   distracted pedestrians when it is safe to cross the road without them
   having to lift their head.

Auditory and tactile signals

   [[366]edit]

   In some jurisdictions such as Australia, pedestrian lights are
   associated with a sound device, for the benefit of blind and visually
   impaired pedestrians. These make a slow beeping sound when the
   pedestrian lights are red and a continuous buzzing or fast beeping
   sound when the lights are green. In the Australian States of
   [367]Queensland, [368]New South Wales, [369]Victoria, and [370]Western
   Australia, the sound is produced in the same unit as the push buttons.
   In a circle above the button on a [371]PB/5 crossing, the sound is
   produced and can be felt along with a raised arrow that points in the
   direction to walk.^[372][57]

   This system of [373]assistive technology is also widely used at busy
   intersections in Canadian cities. In the United Kingdom, the
   [374]Puffin crossings and their predecessor, the [375]Pelican crossing,
   will make a fast beeping sound to indicate that it is safe to cross the
   road. The beeping sound is disabled during the nighttime so as not to
   disturb any nearby residents.^[376][58]

   In some states in the United States, at some busy intersections,
   buttons will make a beeping sound for blind people. When the light
   changes, a speaker built into the button will play a recording to
   notify blind people that it is safe to cross. When the signal flashes
   red, the recording will start to count down with the countdown timer.
   In several countries such as New Zealand, technology also allows deaf
   and blind people to feel when lights have changed to allow safe
   crossing. A small pad, housed within an indentation in the base of the
   box housing the button mechanism, moves downwards when the lights
   change to allow crossing. This is designed to be felt by anyone waiting
   to cross who has limited ability to detect sight or sound.

   In Japan, a traffic light emits an electronic sound that mimics the
   sound of birdsong to help the visually impaired. Some traffic lights
   fix the order and type of sound so that they can tell which direction
   is a green light. In general, "Piyo" (peep) and "Piyo-piyo", which is a
   small bird call, and "Kakkō" and "Ka-kakkō", which is a cuckoo call,
   are associated with this system.^[377][59] Some pedestrian crossings in
   Lithuania make a slow beeping sound indicating that the traffic light
   is about to turn off.

   Where cycle lanes or cycle tracks exist on the approach to a
   signal-controlled junction, it must be considered how to incorporate
   cyclists safely into the junction to reduce conflict between motor
   vehicles and cyclists.

   An [382]advanced stop line can be placed after the stop line at traffic
   lights. This allows cyclists to position themselves in front of traffic
   at a red light and get a headstart.^[383][60]

   In the US, design advice typically advises that the cycle lane should
   continue through the junction to the left of the right-turn lane;
   however, this creates conflict where motor vehicles wish to enter the
   right lane, as they must cross the cycle lane at a bad angle.^[384][61]

   Under Dutch engineering principles, cyclists are instead kept to the
   right of the junction, with protected kerbs. This improves safety by
   putting cyclists into the eyeline of motor vehicles at the stop line,
   allowing cyclists a headstart over turning traffic. This design also
   allows cyclists to complete far-side turns without having to wait in
   the centre of the junction.^[385][61] UK engineers have innovated on
   this design through the Cycle Optimised Protected Signals (CYCLOPS)
   junction, e.g. in [386]Manchester. This places the cycle track around
   the edge of the signal junction and gives cyclists and pedestrians a
   single all-red phase, entirely separate from motor traffic and shortens
   pedestrian crossing times.^[387][62]

   Alternatively, cyclists can be considered pedestrians on approach to a
   junction, or where a cycle track crosses a road and combined
   pedestrian-cyclist traffic lights (known as [388]Toucan crossings in
   the UK) can be provided.^[389][63]

Public transport signals

   [[390]edit]

   Traffic lights for public transport often use signals that are distinct
   from those for private traffic. They can be letters, arrows or bars of
   white or (an LED 100-[391]watt typical) coloured light.

   and "stop" configurations are used. A third signal equal to amber is
   accomplished by flashing the "go" signal.

Public transport signals in Europe

   [[453]edit]

   In some European countries and [454]Russia, dedicated traffic signals
   for public transport (tram, as well any that is using a [455]dedicated
   lane) [456]have four white lights that form the letter
   T.^[[457]citation needed] If the three top lamps are lit, this means
   "stop". If the bottom lamp and some lamps on the top row are lit, this
   means permission to go in a direction shown. In the case of a tram
   signal, if there are no tram junctions or turns at an intersection, a
   simpler system of one amber signal in the form of the letter T is used
   instead; the tram must proceed only when the signal is lit.

   In North European countries, the tram signals feature white lights of
   different forms: "S" for "stop", "—" for "caution" and arrows to permit
   passage in a given direction.^[458][65] In Sweden, All signals use
   white lighting and special symbols ("S", "–" and an arrow) to
   distinguish them from regular signals.

   The [460]Netherlands uses a distinctive "negenoog" (nine-eyed) design
   shown on the top row of the diagram.^[461][66] Bottom row signals are
   used in [462]Belgium, Luxembourg, France, and Germany. The signals mean
   (from left to right): "go straight ahead", "go left", "go right", "go
   in any direction" (like the "green" of a normal traffic light), "stop,
   unless the emergency brake is needed" (equal to "amber"), and "stop"
   (equal to "red").

Public transport signals in the Asia-Pacific region

   [[463]edit]

   In Japan, tram signals are under the regular vehicle signal; however,
   the colour of the signal intended for trams is orange("yellow"). The
   small light at the top tells the driver when the vehicle's
   [464]transponder signal is received by the traffic light. In Hong Kong,
   an amber T-signal is used for trams, in place of the green signal. At
   any tramway junction, another set of signals is available to indicate
   the direction of the tracks. In Australia and New Zealand, a white "B"
   or "T" sometimes replaces the green light indicating that buses or
   trams (respectively) have right of way.

Preemption and priority

   [[469]edit]

   Main articles: [470]Traffic signal preemption and [471]Bus priority

   Some regions have signals that are interruptible, giving priority to
   special traffic, usually [472]emergency vehicles such as
   [473]firefighting apparatus, [474]ambulances, and [475]police
   cars.^[476][67]^[477][68] Most of the systems operate with small
   transmitters that send radio waves, [478]infrared signals, or
   [479]strobe light signals that are received by a sensor on or near the
   traffic lights. Some systems use audio detection, where a certain type
   of siren must be used and detected by a receiver on the traffic light
   structure.

   Upon activation, the normal traffic light cycle is suspended and
   replaced by the "preemption sequence": the traffic lights to all
   approaches to the intersection are switched to "red" with the exception
   of the light for the vehicle that has triggered the preemption
   sequence. Sometimes, an additional signal light is placed nearby to
   indicate to the preempting vehicle that the preempting sequence has
   been activated and to warn other motorists of the approach of an
   emergency vehicle. The normal traffic light cycle resumes after the
   sensor has been passed by the vehicle that triggered the preemption.

   In lieu of preemptive mechanisms, in most jurisdictions, emergency
   vehicles are not required to respect traffic lights. Emergency vehicles
   must slow down, proceed cautiously and activate their emergency lights
   to alert oncoming drivers to the preemption when crossing an
   intersection against the light.^[480][69]^[481][70]

   Unlike preemption, which immediately interrupts a signal's normal
   operation to serve the preempting vehicle and is usually reserved for
   emergency use, "[482]priority" is a set of strategies intended to
   reduce delay for specific vehicles, especially mass transit vehicles
   such as buses. A variety of strategies exist to give priority to
   transit but they all generally work by detecting approaching transit
   vehicles and making small adjustments to the signal timing. These
   adjustments are designed to either decrease the likelihood that the
   transit vehicle will arrive during a red interval or decrease the
   length of the red interval for those vehicles that are stopped.
   Priority does not guarantee that transit vehicles always get a green
   light the instant they arrive as preemption does.

Operation

   [[483]edit]

   Main article: [484]Traffic light control and coordination

   [485][500px-Traffic_Phases_and_Stages.png] A staging diagram for a
   typical signalised T-junction

   A variety of different control systems are used to operate signal
   cycles smoothly, ranging from simple clockwork mechanisms to
   sophisticated computerised control systems. Computerised systems are
   normally [486]actuated, i.e. controlled by [487]loop detectors or other
   sensors on junction approaches. Area-wide coordination can allow
   [488]green wave systems to be set up for vehicles or cycle
   tracks.^[489][71] [490]Smart traffic light systems combine traditional
   actuation, a wider array of sensors and [491]artificial intelligence to
   further improve performance of signal systems.^[492][72] A traffic
   signal junction or crossing is typically controlled by a
   [493]controller mounted inside a cabinet nearby.^[494][73]

   "Phases" (or "signal groups" in Australia and New Zealand) are
   indications shown simultaneously, e.g. multiple green lights which
   control the same traffic approach. A "movement" is any path through the
   junction which vehicles or pedestrians are permitted to take, which is
   "conflicting" if these paths cross one another. A stage (or "phase" in
   ANZ) is a group of non-conflicting phases which move at the same time.
   The stages are collectively known as a "cycle".^[495][74]

   The time between two conflicting green phases is called an "intergreen
   period", which is set at an appropriate length for the junction to
   safely clear, especially for turning traffic which may be waiting in
   the centre of the junction. This often results in an all red stage,
   when all approaches are shown a red light and no vehicle can proceed.
   This all red is sometimes extended to allow a [496]pedestrian scramble,
   where pedestrians can cross the empty junction in any direction all at
   once.^[497][75] Some signals have no "all red" phase: the light turns
   green for cross traffic the instant the other light turns red.^[498][c]

   Many traffic light installations are fitted with vehicle actuation,
   i.e. detection, to improve the flexibility of traffic systems to
   respond to varying traffic flows. Detectors come in the form of
   [499]digital sensors fitted to the signal heads or [500]induction loops
   within the road surface. Induction loops are beneficial due to their
   smaller chance of breakdown, but their simplicity can limit their
   ability to handle some situations, particularly involving lighter
   vehicles such as motorcycles or pedal cycles.^[501][76] This situation
   most often occurs at times of day when other traffic is sparse as well
   as when the small vehicle is coming from a direction that does not have
   a high volume of traffic.^[502][77]

Timing

   [[503]edit]

   Main article: [504]Signal timing

   [505][250px-Traffic_light_in_Tehran.jpg] A traffic light with a timer
   in [506]Tehran, Iran

   The timing of the intergreen is usually based on the size of the
   intersection, which can range from two to five seconds.^[[507]citation
   needed] Modelling programs include the ability to calculate intergreen
   times automatically. Intergreen periods are determined by calculating
   the path distance for every conflict point in the junction, which is
   the distance travelled to the conflict point by the movement losing
   right of way minus the distance travelled to the same conflict point by
   the movement gaining right of way using the possible conflict points
   (including with pedestrians) and calculating both the time it would
   take the last vehicle to clear the furthest collision point and the
   first vehicle from the next stage to arrive at the conflict point. At
   actuated junctions, integreens can be varied to account for traffic
   conditions.^[508][21]

   Engineers also need to set the amber timings (and red–amber, where
   appropriate), which is normally standardised by a traffic authority.
   For example, in the UK, the amber time is fixed nationally at three
   seconds and the red–amber time at two seconds, which results in a
   minimum intergreen time of five seconds (plus any all-red
   time).^[509][21] The US also uses a minimum of three seconds, but local
   traffic authorities can make timings longer, especially on wider,
   suburban roads. This variation has resulted in controversy when
   municipalities with shorter amber times use red light
   cameras.^[510][78] Where pedestrian signals are used, the timing of the
   "inivitation to cross" – the period where a steady walk signal shows –
   and clearance periods – time when the walk signal flashes or no signal
   is shown – need to be calculated. This is normally set against a design
   speed, e.g. 1.2 m/s (3.9 ft/s). Similarly, these can be made extendable
   using sensors, allowing slower-moving pedestrians more time to cross
   the street.^[511][21]

Design guidance

   [[512]edit]

   National or sub-national highway authorities often issue guidance
   documents on the specification of traffic signals and design of
   signalised intersections according to national or local regulations.
   For example, in the United States the [513]Federal Highway
   Administration issues the [514]Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
   Devices and the Signalized Intersections Information Guide, which is a
   synthesis of best practices and treatments to help practitioners make
   informed decisions.^[515][79]

Variable lane control

   [[516]edit]

   Main article: [517]Lane control lights

   [518][250px-Lane_signals_en.svg.png] An LED 50-[519]watt typical lane
   control signal head[520]Lane control signals installed on the Montréal
   Old Champlain Bridge. Lane control signals installed on the Old
   Champlain Bridge in [521]Montréal, Canada

   Variable lane control is a form of intelligent transportation systems
   which involve the use of lane-use control signals, typically on a
   [522]gantry above a carriageway. These lights are used in [523]tidal
   flow systems to allow or forbid traffic to use one or more of the
   available lanes by the use of green lights or arrows (to permit) or by
   red lights or crosses (to prohibit).^[524][80] Variable lane control
   may be in use at toll plazas to indicate open or closed booths; during
   heavy traffic to facilitate merging traffic from a slip road.^[525][80]

   In the US, most notably the Southeastern, there often is a
   "continuous-flow" lane. This lane is protected by a single,
   constant-green arrow pointing down at the lane(s) permitting the
   continuous flow of traffic, without regard to the condition of signals
   for other lanes or cross streets. Continuous lanes are restricted in
   that vehicles turning from a side street may not cross over the double
   white line to enter the continuous lane. No lane changes are permitted
   to the continuous lane from an adjacent lane or from the continuous
   lane to an adjacent lane, until the double white line has been passed.
   Some continuous lanes are protected by a raised curb located between
   the continuous lane and a normal traffic lane, with white and/or amber
   reflective paint or tape, prohibiting turning or adjacent traffic from
   entering the lane.^[[526]citation needed]

   Continuous-flow traffic lanes are found only at "T" intersections where
   there is no side street or driveway entrance on the right side of the
   main thoroughfare. No pedestrians are permitted to cross the main
   thoroughfare at intersections with a continuous-flow lane, although
   crossing at the side street may be permitted.

   Intersections with continuous-flow lanes will be posted with a white
   regulatory sign approximately 500 ft (150 m) before the intersection
   with the phrase, "right lane continuous traffic," or other, similar,
   wording. If the arrow is extinguished for any reason, whether by
   malfunction or design, traffic through the continuous lane will revert
   to the normal traffic pattern for adjacent lanes, except that turning
   or moving into or out of the restricted lane is still
   prohibited.^[[527]citation needed]

Waterways and railways

   [[528]edit]

   The three-aspect standard is also used at [529]locks on the Upper
   Mississippi River. Red means that another vessel is passing through.
   Amber means that the lock chamber is being emptied or filled to match
   the level of the approaching vessel. After the gate opens, green means
   that the vessel may enter.
   [530][250px-Railway_signal_FE6453_-_geograph.org.uk_-_7498570.jpg]

   Railroad signals, for stopping trains in their own right of way,
   generally use the opposite positioning of the colours; that is, for
   signals above the driver's eyeline, green on top and red below is the
   [531]standard placement of the signal colours on railroad tracks. There
   are three reasons for this variation: there is no risk that railway
   signals will be masked by a tall vehicle between the driver and the
   signal; train speeds in fog are much higher than for road vehicles, so
   it is important that the most restrictive signal is closest to the
   driver's eyeline; and with railway signals often in exposed rural
   locations, there is a risk of any signal other than the bottom one
   being masked by snow building up on the hood of the signal below.

Rules

   [[532]edit]

   Main article: [533]Rules for traffic lights

   [534][250px-Red_light_fine_sign.jpg] [535]California attempts to
   discourage red light running by posting the minimum fine.

   Traffic lights control flows of traffic using [536]social norms and
   legal rules. In most jurisdictions, it is against the law to disobey
   traffic signals and the police, or devices such as [537]red light
   cameras, can issue fines or other penalties – and in some cases
   prosecute – drivers who break those laws.^[538][81] US-based studies
   have found that the majority of drivers think that it is dangerous to
   run a red light at speed and the most common reason for red light
   running include inattentive driving, following an oversized vehicle or
   during inclement weather.^[539][82]^[540][83]

   The rules governing traffic light junctions for vehicles differ by
   jurisdiction. For example, it is common in [541]North America that
   drivers can turn kerb-to-kerb (i.e. turning right at most junctions),
   even when a red light shows.^[542][84]^[543][85] This [544]turn on red
   rule is uncommon in Europe, unless an arrow signal or traffic sign
   specifically permits it.^[545][86]^[546][87]^[547][88]^[548][89]

Design

   [[549]edit]

Bulbs

   [[550]edit]

   Conventional traffic signal lighting, still common in some areas, uses
   a standard light bulb. The light then bounces off a mirrored glass or
   polished aluminium reflector bowl, and out through a polycarbonate
   plastic or glass signal lens. In some signals, these lenses were cut to
   include a specific refracting pattern. Traditionally, incandescent and
   halogen bulbs were used. Because of the low efficiency of light output
   and a single point of failure (filament burnout), some traffic
   authorities are choosing to retrofit traffic signals with [551]LED
   arrays that consume less power, have increased light output, and last
   significantly longer.^[[552]citation needed]

   In the event of an individual LED failure, the aspect will still
   operate albeit with a reduced light output. The light pattern of an LED
   array can be comparable to the pattern of an incandescent or halogen
   bulb fitted with a [553]prismatic lens.

   The low energy consumption of LED lights can pose a driving risk in
   some areas during winter. Unlike incandescent and halogen bulbs, which
   generally get hot enough to melt away any snow that may settle on
   individual lights, LED displays – using only a fraction of the energy –
   remain too cool for this to happen.^[554][90]^[555][91] As a response
   to the safety concerns, a heating element on the lens was
   developed.^[556][92]^[557][93]

Programmable visibility signals

   [[558]edit]

   Traffic signals installed in [559]Shelton, Washington, seen off-axis
   from the intended viewing area (top) and from the signal's intended
   viewing area (bottom).
   From off-axis, these signals appear to be "off" or invisible to
   adjacent lanes of traffic during the daytime. Only a faint glow can be
   seen when viewed at night.

   Signals such as the 3M High Visibility Signal utilise light-diffusing
   optics and a [560]Fresnel lens to create the signal indication. The
   light from a 150 W PAR46 sealed-beam lamp in these "programmable
   visibility" signals passes through a set of two glass lenses at the
   back of the signal. The first lens, a frosted glass diffusing lens,
   diffuses the light into a uniform ball of light around five inches in
   diameter. The light then passes through a nearly identical lens known
   as an optical limiter (3M's definition of the lens itself), also known
   as a "programming lens", also five inches in diameter.^[[561]citation
   needed]

   Using a special aluminium foil-based adhesive tape, these signals are
   "masked" or programmed by the programming lens so that only certain
   lanes of traffic will view the indication. At the front of these
   programmable visibility signals is a 12" Fresnel lens, each lens tinted
   to meet United States [562]Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)
   chromaticity and luminance standards. The Fresnel lens collimates the
   light output created by the lamp and creates a uniform display of light
   for the lane in which it is intended.

   In addition to being positioned and mounted for desired visibility for
   their respective traffic, some traffic lights are also aimed, louvered,
   or shaded to minimise misinterpretation from other lanes. For example,
   a Fresnel lens on an adjacent through-lane signal may be aimed to
   prevent left-turning traffic from anticipating its own green arrow.
   Intelight Inc. manufactures a programmable traffic signal that uses a
   software-controlled LED array and electronics to steer the light beam
   toward the desired approach.^[563][94]

   The signal is programmed unlike the 3M and McCain models. It requires a
   connection to a laptop or smartphone with the manufacturer's software
   installed. Connections can be made directly with a direct-serial
   interface kit, or wirelessly with a radio kit over WIFI to the signal.
   In addition to aiming, Fresnel lenses, and louvers, visors and back
   panels are also useful in areas where sunlight would diminish the
   contrast and visibility of a signal face. Typical applications for
   these signals were skewed intersections, specific multi-lane control,
   left-turn pocket signals, or other areas where complex traffic
   situations existed.

Size

   [[565]edit]

   In the United States, traffic lights are currently designed with lights
   approximately 12 inches (300 mm) in diameter. Previously the standard
   had been 8 inches (200 mm); however, those are slowly being phased out
   in favour of the larger and more visible 12 inch lights. Variations
   used have also included a hybrid design, which had one or more 12 inch
   lights along with one or more lights of 8 inches (200 mm) on the same
   light.

   In the United Kingdom, 12-inch lights were implemented only with Mellor
   Design Signal heads designed by [566]David Mellor. These were designed
   for symbolic optics to compensate for the light loss caused by the
   symbol. Following a study sponsored by the UK Highways Agency and
   completed by Aston University, Birmingham, UK, an enhanced optical
   design was introduced in the mid-1990s.

   Criticism^[[567]by whom?] of sunlight washout (cannot see the
   illuminated signal due to sunlight falling on it), and sun-phantom
   (signal appearing to be illuminated even when not due to sunlight
   reflecting from the parabolic mirror at low sun angles), led to the
   design of a signal that used lenslets to focus light from a traditional
   incandescent bulb through apertures in a matt black front mask. This
   cured both problems in an easily manufactured solution. This design
   proved successful and was taken into production by a number of traffic
   signal manufacturers through the engineering designs of Dr. Mark Aston,
   working firstly at the SIRA Ltd in Kent, and latterly as an independent
   optical designer.^[[568]citation needed]

   The manufacturers took a licence for the generic design from the
   Highways Agency, with Dr. Aston engineering a unique solution for each
   manufacturer. Producing both bulb and LED versions of the signal
   aspects, these signals are still the most common type of traffic light
   on UK roads. With the invention of anti-phantom, highly visible Aston
   lenses, lights of 8 inches (200 mm) could be designed to give the same
   output as plain lenses, so a larger surface area was unnecessary.
   Consequently, lights of 12 inches (300 mm) are no longer approved for
   use in the UK and all lights installed on new installations have to be
   200 mm (8 in) in accordance with TSRGD (Traffic Signs Regulations and
   General Directions). Exemptions are made for temporary or replacement
   signals.^[[569]citation needed]

   The MUTCD identifies five types of traffic light mounts. On pedestals,
   signal heads are mounted on a single pole. This is the normal
   installation method for the UK.^[584][96]^[585][21] On mast arms,
   signal heads are mounted on a rigid arm over the road protuding from
   the pole. On strained poles, signals are suspended over a roadway on a
   wire, attached to poles at opposite kerbs. This is the most common
   installation method in the United States. Unipoles are similar to
   strain poles, but a single structure over the road, rather than two
   poles linked with wire. Signals can be attached to existing structures
   such as an overpass.^[586][96] Dummy lights are traffic signs located
   in the centre of a junction, which operate on a fixed cycle. These have
   generally been decommissioned due to safety concerns. A number remain
   due to historic value.^[587][97]

   Signals can either be placed nearside – between the stop line and the
   kerbline of the intersecting road – or farside – on the opposite side
   of the junction. In European countries, signals are often placed on the
   nearside.^[593][98] In the UK, at least two signal heads are required,
   known as the primary and secondary heads, one of which is normally
   nearside and the other of which could be nearside or farside.^[594][21]
   In the US, signals are normally located farside, though in some states,
   nearside signals are also used. Nearside signals can be beneficial to
   road safety, as drivers have more time to see a red light and are less
   likely to encroach on pedestrian crossings.^[595][98]

Effects

   [[596]edit]

   Drivers spend on average around 2% of journey time passing through
   signalised junctions.^[597][99] Traffic lights can increase the traffic
   capacity at intersections and reduce delay for side road traffic, but
   can also result in increased delay for main road traffic.^[598][100]
   [599]Hans Monderman, the innovative Dutch traffic engineer, and pioneer
   of [600]shared space schemes, was sceptical of their role, and is
   quoted as having said of them: "We only want traffic lights where they
   are useful and I haven't found anywhere where they are useful
   yet."^[601][101]

   A World Economic Forum study found that signalised junctions are linked
   to higher rates of localised air pollution. Drivers accelerate and stop
   frequently at lights and as such peak particle concentration can be
   around 29 times higher than during free-flow conditions. The WEF
   recommends that traffic authorities synchronise traffic signals,
   consider alternative traffic management systems and consider placing
   traffic lights away from residential areas, schools, and
   hospitals.^[602][99]

   The separation of conflicting streams of traffic in time can reduce the
   chances of right-angle collisions by turning traffic and cross traffic,
   but they can increase the frequency of rear-end crashes by up to
   50%.^[603][102] Since right-angled and turn-against-traffic collisions
   are more likely to result in injuries, this is often an acceptable
   trade-off. They can also adversely affect the safety of bicycle and
   pedestrian traffic. Between 1979 and 1988, the city of
   [604]Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, removed signals at 199 intersections
   that were not warranted. On average, the intersections had 24% fewer
   crashes after the unwarranted signals were removed.^[605][102] The
   traffic lights had been erected in the 1960s because of since-resolved
   protests over traffic. By 1992, over 800 traffic lights had been
   removed at 426 intersections, and the number of crashes at these
   intersections dropped by 60%.^[606][103]

Justification

   [[607]edit]

   Globe icon.
   The examples and perspective in this section deal primarily with the
   United States and do not represent a [608]worldwide view of the
   subject. You may [609]improve this section, discuss the issue on the
   [610]talk page, or create a new section, as appropriate. (December
   2010) ([611]Learn how and when to remove this message)

   Criteria have been developed to help ensure that new traffic lights are
   installed only where they will do more good than harm and to justify
   the removal of existing traffic lights where they are not warranted.
   They are most often placed on arterial roads at intersections with
   either another arterial road or a collector road, or on an expressway
   where an interchange is not warranted. In some situations, traffic
   signals can also be found on collector roads in busy settings.

United States

   [[612]edit]

   The [613]International Municipal Signal Association provides input as
   to standards concerning traffic signals and control devices. One
   example is the input the association provided for the [614]Manual on
   Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).^[[615]citation needed] The
   MUTCD is issued by the [616]Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) of
   the [617]United States Department of Transportation (USDOT).^[618][104]

   In the United States, the criteria for installation of a traffic
   control signal are prescribed by the [619]Manual on Uniform Traffic
   Control Devices (MUTCD), which defines the criteria in nine
   warrants:^[620][105]
     * Eight-hour vehicular volume. Traffic volume must exceed prescribed
       minima for eight hours of an average weekday.
     * Four-hour vehicular volume. Traffic volume must exceed prescribed
       minima for four hours of an average weekday.
     * Peak hour volume or delay. This is applied only in unusual cases,
       such as [621]office parks, industrial complexes, and [622]park and
       ride lots that attract or discharge large numbers of vehicles in a
       short time, and for a minimum of one hour of an average weekday.
       The side road traffic suffers undue delays when entering or
       crossing the major street.
     * Pedestrian volume. If the traffic volume on a major street is so
       heavy that pedestrians experience excessive delays in attempting to
       cross it.
     * School crossing. If the traffic density at school crossing times
       exceeds one per minute which is considered to provide too few gaps
       in the traffic for children to safely cross the street.
     * Coordinated signal system. For places where adjacent traffic
       control signals do not keep traffic grouped together efficiently.
     * Crash experience. The volumes in the eight- and four-hour warrants
       may be reduced if five or more right-angle and cross traffic turn
       collisions have happened at the intersection in a twelve-month
       period.
     * Roadway network. Installing a traffic control signal at some
       intersections might be justified to encourage concentration and
       organisation of traffic flow on a roadway network.
     * Intersection near a grade crossing. A traffic control signal is
       often justified at an intersection near a [623]railroad crossing,
       in order to provide a preemption sequence to allow traffic queued
       up on the tracks an opportunity to clear the tracks before the
       train arrives.

   In the US, an intersection is usually required to meet one or more of
   these warrants before a signal is installed. However, meeting one or
   more warrants does not require the installation of a traffic signal, it
   only suggests that they may be suitable. It could be that a
   [624]roundabout would work better. There may be other unconsidered
   conditions that lead traffic engineers to conclude that a signal is
   undesirable. For example, it may be decided not to install a signal at
   an intersection if traffic stopped by it will back up and block
   another, more heavily trafficked intersection. Also, if a signal meets
   only the peak hour warrant, the advantages during that time may not
   outweigh the disadvantages during the rest of the day.

China

   [[625]edit]

   In China, the standards for setting traffic signals is defined in
   [626]GB 14886-2016: Specifications for road traffic signal setting and
   installation, published in 2016 and implemented in 2017. A signal shall
   be placed at intersections that meet the following criteria:^[627][106]
     * Peak hour vehicular volume exceeds prescribed minima
     * A continuous eight-hour average vehicular volume exceeds prescribed
       minima
     * Accident history
          + On average, more than 5 accidents that could have been
            prevented with traffic signals per year in the past 3 years
          + On average, more than 1 fatal accidents
     * Any intersections that meet 80% of the two of the three criteria
       listed above
     * Entrance to one way streets for vehicular traffic
     * Pedestrian signals shall be placed at signalised intersections with
       crosswalk marks
     * Intersections with exclusive turning lanes and multiple signal
       phases shall use turning traffic signal
     * [628]Reversible lanes, tunnels, and [629]tollbooths
     * For bi-directional roads with more than three vehicular lanes, if
       vehicular and pedestrian traffic exceeds prescribed minima, a
       pedestrian signal and a vehicular signal shall be used

   Additionally, the standard recommended a few situations, such as
   intersections within a coordinated light control systems, where signals
   may be placed.^[630][106]

In other contexts

   [[631]edit]

   The symbolism of a traffic light (and the meanings of the three primary
   colours used in traffic lights) are frequently found in many other
   contexts. Since they are often used as single spots of colour without
   the context of vertical position, they are typically not comprehensible
   to up to one in ten males who are [632]colour blind.^[[633]citation
   needed]

   Traffic lights have also been used in computer software, such as the
   [634]macOS [635]user interface, and in pieces of artwork, particularly
   [636]Traffic Light Tree in London, UK.

Racing

   [[637]edit]

   See also: [638]Racing flags

   Automobile racing circuits can also use standard traffic signals to
   indicate to racing car drivers the status of racing. On an oval track,
   four sets may be used, two facing a straight-away and two facing the
   middle of the 180-degree turn between straight-away. Green would
   indicate racing is underway, while amber would indicate to slow or
   while following a pace car; red would indicate to stop, probably for
   emergency reasons.

   [639]Scuderia Ferrari, a [640]Formula One racing team, formerly used a
   traffic light system during their pit stops to signal to their drivers
   when to leave the pits.^[[641]citation needed] The red light was on
   when the tires were being changed and fuel was being added, amber was
   on when the tires were changed, and green was on when all work was
   completed. The system is (usually) completely automatic. However, the
   system was withdrawn after the [642]2008 Singapore Grand Prix, due to
   the fact that it heavily delayed [643]Felipe Massa during the race,
   when he was in the lead.

   Usually, the system was automatic, but heavy traffic in the pit lane
   forced the team to operate it manually. A mechanic accidentally pressed
   the green light button when the fuel hose was still attached to the
   car, causing Massa to drive off, towing the fuel hose along.
   Additionally, Massa drove into the path of [644]Adrian Sutil, earning
   him a penalty. He finally stopped at the end of the pit lane, forcing
   Ferrari's mechanics to sprint down the whole of the pit lane to remove
   the hose. As a result of this, and the penalty he also incurred, Massa
   finished 13th. Ferrari decided to use a traditional "lollipop" for the
   remainder of the [645]2008 season.

   Another type of traffic light that is used in racing is the Christmas
   Tree, which is used in [646]drag racing. The Christmas Tree has six
   lights: a blue staging light, three amber lights, a green light, and a
   red light. The blue staging light is divided into two parts: Pre-stage
   and stage. Sometimes, there are two sets of bulbs on top of each other
   to represent them. Once a driver is staged at the starting line, then
   the starter will activate the light to commence racing, which can be
   done in two ways. If a Pro tree is used, then the three amber lights
   will flash at the same time. For the Sportsman tree, the amber light
   will flash from top to bottom. When the green light comes up, the race
   officially begins but if a driver crosses the line before that happens,
   then a red light will come up and that will be a foul. ^[[647]citation

As a rating mechanism

   [[648]edit]

   See also: [649]Traffic light rating system and [650]European Union
   energy label

   The colours red, amber, and green are often used as a
   simple-to-understand rating system for products and processes. It may
   be extended by analogy to provide a greater range of intermediate
   colours, with red and green at the extremes.^[651][107]

In Unicode

   [[652]edit]

   In [653]Unicode, the symbol for U+1F6A5
   🚥 HORIZONTAL TRAFFIC LIGHT is HORIZONTAL TRAFFIC LIGHT and U+1F6A6 🚦
   VERTICAL TRAFFIC LIGHT is VERTICAL TRAFFIC LIGHT.

Notes

   [[672]edit]

    1. [673]^ Not completely correct: a variable speed sign is not solely
       used for the purpose of slowing the speed of motorists approaching
       an intersection. They are also used on freeways where the maximum
       safe speed is dependent on the conditions of the roadway (i.e.
       weather, falling rocks, risk of wildlife, etc.), such as in British
       Columbia, Canada.^[[674]clarification needed]
    2. [675]^ The Barnes Dance is named after an American traffic
       engineer, [676]Henry A. Barnes. Barnes did not claim to have
       invented the system but was a strong advocate of it, having
       observed the difficulties his daughter faced crossing the road to
       get to school.
    3. [677]^ These are typically older signals. There are many examples
       in Houston, Texas, of this. Suspended lights constructed so that a
       single source simultaneously illuminates all four directions always
       have this characteristic: Red (in two directions) and green (in the
       two cross directions) with Red-Yellow-Green sequence on two sides
       and Green-Yellow-Red sequence on the cross sides^[[678]citation

       [685]R.U.R. by [686]Karel Čapek which debuted in England in 1923
       and introduced the term 'robot' to an English audience. For a short
       time in England it was fashionable to use 'robot' for 'traffic
       light' from the late 1920s, when traffic lights were being
       installed in England. This usage travelled to South Africa in the
       early 1930s, when they had their first traffic lights installed,
       and where it continues to be used almost 90 years later, while
       'robot' for 'traffic light' fell out of usage in England. See
