Visible Light

What is the visible light spectrum?

   The visible light spectrum is the segment of the electromagnetic
   spectrum that the human eye can view. More simply, this range of
   wavelengths is called visible light. Typically, the human eye can
   detect wavelengths from 380 to 700 nanometers.

WAVELENGTHS OF VISIBLE LIGHT

   All electromagnetic radiation is light, but we can only see a small
   portion of this radiation—the portion we call visible light.
   Cone-shaped cells in our eyes act as receivers tuned to the wavelengths
   in this narrow band of the spectrum. Other portions of the spectrum
   have wavelengths too large or too small and energetic for the
   biological limitations of our perception.

   As the full spectrum of visible light travels through a prism, the
   wavelengths separate into the colors of the rainbow because each color
   is a different wavelength. Violet has the shortest wavelength, at
   around 380 nanometers, and red has the longest wavelength, at around
   700 nanometers.
   Left: A 3D illustration of 2 prisms. As light shine through one, it is
   refracted into the colors of the rainbow. As the full spectrum of light
   - the rainbow - travels through the second prism, the waves are
   recombined into white light. Right: illustration of each wavelength in
   the spectrum
   (Left) Isaac Newton's experiment in 1665 showed that a prism bends
   visible light andthat each color refracts at a slightly different angle
   depending on the wavelength of the color.Credit: Troy Benesch.(Right)
   Each color in a rainbow corresponds to a different wavelength of
   electromagnetic spectrum.

THE SUN'S CORONA

   The Sun is the dominant source for visible-light waves our eyes
   receive. The outer-most layer of the Sun's atmosphere, the corona, can
   be seen in visible light. But it is so faint it cannot not be seen
   except during a total solar eclipse because the bright photosphere
   overwhelms it. The photograph below was taken during a total eclipse of
   the Sun where the photosphere and chromosphere are almost completely
   blocked by the moon. The tapered patterns—coronal streamers—around the
   Sun are formed by the outward flow of plasma that is shaped by magnetic
   field lines extending millions of miles into space.

   streamers that are normally too faint to see over the intense light of
   the sun's chromosphere.

COLOR AND TEMPERATURE

   As objects grow hotter, they radiate energy dominated by shorter
   wavelengths, changing color before our eyes. A flame on a blow torch
   shifts from reddish to bluish in color as it is adjusted to burn
   hotter. In the same way, the color of stars tells scientists about
   their temperature.

   Our Sun produces more yellow light than any other color because its
   surface temperature is 5,500°C. If the Sun's surface were cooler—say
   3,000°C—it would look reddish, like the star Betelgeuse. If the Sun
   were hotter—say, 12,000°C—it would look blue, like the star Rigel.

   Isaac Newton's experiment in 1665 showed that a prism bends visible
   light and that each color refracts at a slightly different angle
   depending on the wavelength of the color.
   An image of the surface of the Sun appearing warm yellow. A temperature
   gauge on the left side shows the hotter star Rigel as blue and the
   cooler star Betelgeuse as red.

SPECTRA AND SPECTRAL SIGNATURES

   Close examination of the visible-light spectrum from our Sun and other
   stars reveals a pattern of dark lines—called absorption lines. These
   patterns can provide important scientific clues that reveal hidden
   properties of objects throughout the universe. Certain elements in the
   Sun's atmosphere absorb certain colors of light. These patterns of
   lines within spectra act like fingerprints for atoms and molecules.
   Looking at the Sun's spectrum, for example, the fingerprints for
   elements are clear to those knowledgeable about those patterns.
   An image of the full spectrum of visible light - the rainbow - with
   dark lines appearing in the red, orange-yellow, and green-blue areas of
   the spectrum. These dark lines indicate that these specific wavelengths
   are missing and can be aligned to the elements that absorb these
   specific wavelengths - hydrogen, sodium, and magnesium.

   Patterns are also evident in a graph of an object's reflectance.
   Elements, molecules, and even cell structures have unique signatures of
   reflectance. A graph of an object's reflectance across a spectrum is
   called a spectral signature. Spectral signatures of different Earth
   features within the visible light spectrum ARE shown below.
   A graph showing wavelengths in nanometers on the x-axis and percent
   reflectance on the y-axis. Snow, ice and clouds show a high reflectance
   across all wavelengths. Dry soil, wet soil, turbid water and clear
   water all seem to reflect similar values in the blue and green
   wavelengths, but have very different value closer to red and infrared
   where soils reflect more than water. Vegetation reflects more in the
   green and infrared than in the blue and red.

ACTIVE REMOTE SENSING—ALTIMETRY

   Laser altimetry is an example of active remote sensing using visible
   light. NASA's Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) instrument
   onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) enabled
   scientists to calculate the elevation of Earth's polar ice sheets using
   lasers and ancillary data. Changes in elevation over time help to
   estimate variations in the amount of water stored as ice on our planet.
   The image below shows elevation data over the West Antarctic Ice
   Streams.

   Laser altimeters can also make unique measurements of the heights and
   characteristics of clouds, as well as the top and structure of the
   vegetation canopy of forests. They can also sense the distribution of
   aerosols from sources such as dust storms and forest fires.
   An oblique image of ice streams at the edge of Antarctica is shown here
   with a super-imposed vertical profile revealing the height of ice in
   and around the streams.
