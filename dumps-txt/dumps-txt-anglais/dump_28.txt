     * [228]Mitigating the Effects of Blue Light

   Key Takeaways
     * Blue light is a wavelength of light often emitted by electronic
       devices and artificial lights.
     * During the day, blue light influences your circadian rhythm,
       affecting alertness and heart rate.
     * Limiting blue light at night can help mitigate its effects on
       sleep.

   The screens of electronic devices such as smartphones, computers,
   tablets, and televisions can emit blue light that disrupts our natural
   sleep cycles. Research shows that a majority of Americans use
   electronic devices within an hour of going to bed, which can lead to
   unsatisfactory sleep. Decreasing exposure to light in the evening, and
   blue light in particular, is an important way to help your body
   naturally prepare for sleep and get quality rest.

What Is Blue Light?

   Light is composed of electromagnetic radiation, which is an invisible
   form of energy. Our eyes interpret colors of light based on the amount
   of energy they contain. White light, including some light emitted by
   the sun, is the combination of all the colors of the visible light
   spectrum.

   Blue light is a portion of the visible light spectrum that can
   influence alertness, hormone production, and sleep cycles. This
   wavelength of light is emitted by LED and fluorescent lights, as well
   as many [229]electronic devices.

How Does Blue Light Affect Circadian Rhythms?

   [230]Circadian rhythms are finely tuned, 24-hour cycles that signal our
   bodies to carry out essential functions [231]Trusted Source National
   Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for
   Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing
   access to biomedical and genomic information. [232]View Source ,
   including sleep. Light is the most important factor in aligning
   circadian rhythms [233]Trusted Source Harvard University Harvard is the
   oldest institution of higher education in the United States,
   established in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the
   Massachusetts Bay Colony. [234]View Source and, for much of human
   history, these rhythms were closely aligned with sunrise and sunset
   [235]Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information
   The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and
   health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information.
   [236]View Source .

   With the advent of artificial light and electronics, people are being
   exposed to increased amounts of light before bedtime. While all types
   of visible light can affect circadian rhythms, blue light has the
   largest impact [237]Trusted Source National Library of Medicine,
   Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information
   advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and
   genomic information. [238]View Source .

   We get most of our exposure to blue light from the sun. Blue light
   stimulates parts of the brain that make us feel alert [239]Trusted
   Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National
   Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by
   providing access to biomedical and genomic information. [240]View
   Source , elevating our body temperature and heart rate. During the day,
   blue light can improve performance and attention, tuning our circadian
   rhythms and setting us up for a better night’s sleep after the sun
   sets.

   Strategically timed exposure to blue light can help treat several sleep
   disorders. [241]Circadian rhythm disorders occur when a person’s
   circadian rhythms are not in alignment with their environment. Light
   therapy, and blue light in particular [242]Trusted Source National
   Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for
   Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing
   access to biomedical and genomic information. [243]View Source , can
   help realign the body’s circadian rhythms and improve sleep.

   Inversely, [244]exposure to blue light in the hours leading up to
   bedtime can hinder sleep. Blue light suppresses the body’s release of
   melatonin [245]Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech
   Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances
   science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic
   information. [246]View Source , a hormone that makes us feel drowsy.
   While this promotes wakefulness during the day, it becomes unhelpful at
   night when we are trying to sleep. Being exposed to blue light in the
   evening can trick our brain into thinking it is still daytime,
   disrupting circadian rhythms and leaving us feeling alert instead of
   tired.

   Chronic misalignment of circadian rhythms can also lead to many
   negative health impacts [247]Trusted Source National Library of
   Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology
   Information advances science and health by providing access to
   biomedical and genomic information. [248]View Source , including
   metabolic disorders and mental health conditions such as
   [249]depression. Being mindful of the sources of blue light and daily
   exposure levels can help reduce the risk of these negative health
   outcomes.

What Devices Emit Blue Light?

   Many people work under artificial lights and constantly interact with
   the screens of electronic devices. Being aware of these common sources
   of artificial blue light can help you strategically time exposure and
   avoid circadian rhythm disruptions.

   Common sources of blue light include:
     * Fluorescent lights
     * LED lights
     * Smartphones
     * Televisions
     * Computer screens
     * Tablets
     * E-readers
     * Video game consoles

   The good news is that the risks of nighttime blue light exposure can be
   reduced through relatively simple methods.

Mitigating the Effects of Blue Light

   The most effective way to reduce exposure to blue light in the evening
   is to simply turn off the sources. This means dimming or reducing LED
   and fluorescent lighting in your home and turning off electronic
   devices after it gets dark outside.

   Specialty glasses may also be helpful in reducing exposure to blue
   light. While they may not work for everyone, [250]blue light blocking
   or amber glasses can reduce the melatonin-suppressing effects of bright
   light [251]Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech
   Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances
   science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic
   information. [252]View Source .

   It may not always be feasible to turn off sources of blue light after
   dark, but there are a variety of ways to reduce blue light exposure
   that may be interfering with your sleep.
     * Make it a routine: Set an alarm that reminds you to turn off
       electronics two to three hours before bedtime.
     * Use a different lamp: If you enjoy [253]reading in bed, try a lamp
       that emits red or orange light rather than blue.
     * Learn to dim: Dim the brightness of your electronic screens, or use
       the “night mode” feature found on some devices.
     * Try an app: If you need to use devices before bed, try out one of
       several smartphone and computer applications that can help reduce
       blue light emission.
     * Improve your sleeping environment: If there are light sources in
       your bedroom that you are unable to dim or turn off, try using an
       eye mask to block them out once you are in bed.
