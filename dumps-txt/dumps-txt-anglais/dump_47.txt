   What is Diwali?

   Diwali, also spelled Divali, is one of the major religious festivals in
   [101]Hinduism, [102]Jainism, and [103]Sikhism. The name is derived from
   the [104]Sanskrit term dipavali, meaning “row of lights.” The festival
   generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness.

   Which religions celebrate Diwali?

   Diwali is one of the major religious festivals in [105]Hinduism,
   [106]Jainism, and [107]Sikhism. Although not a primary festival of
   [108]Buddhism, Diwali is celebrated by some Buddhists as a
   commemoration of the day when Emperor [109]Ashoka converted to Buddhism
   in the 3rd century bce.

   Do Sikhs celebrate Diwali?

   Since the 18th century, Diwali has been celebrated in [110]Sikhism as
   the time of [111]Guru Hargobind’s return to [112]Amritsar from
   captivity in [113]Gwalior, an echo of [114]Rama’s return to
   [115]Ayodhya. Residents of Amritsar lit lamps throughout the city to
   celebrate the occasion.

   Do Jains celebrate Diwali?

   Diwali is an important festival in [116]Jainism. For the Jain
   community, the festival commemorates the enlightenment and liberation
   ([117]moksha) of [118]Mahavira, the most recent of the Jain
   [119]Tirthankaras, from the cycle of life and death ([120]samsara). The
   lighting of the lamps celebrates the light of Mahavira’s holy
   knowledge.

   How is Diwali celebrated?

   People [121]celebrate Diwali differently depending on region and
   tradition. [122]Hindus light [123]diyas (earthenware lamps) on the new
   moon night to honor [124]Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. People
   exchange gifts, wear new clothes, feast, feed the poor, and set off
   fireworks (though these are now restricted to curb pollution).

   Diwali, one of the major religious festivals in [126]Hinduism,
   [127]Jainism, and [128]Sikhism, lasting for five days from the 13th day
   of the dark half of the lunar month Ashvina to the second day of the
   light half of the lunar month Karttika. (The corresponding dates in the
   [129]Gregorian calendar usually fall in late October and November.) The
   name is derived from the Sanskrit term dipavali, meaning “row of
   lights.” The [130]festival generally symbolizes the victory of light
   over darkness.

History

   Diwali developed over centuries from local traditions that occur on the
   days surrounding the new moon day of Karttika. The most ancient mention
   of the holiday can be found in the [131]Kamasutra of Vatsyayana (3rd
   century ce). In that instance it is called Yaksharatri, or night of
   [132]yakshas (nature spirits led by [133]Kubera, the god of wealth).
   The [134]Puranas (400–1500) provide the most [135]comprehensive picture
   of Diwali, but the festival is also mentioned in other sources, such as
   in the local Purana from [136]Kashmir called Nilamata Purana (c. 7th
   century), in the Yashastilaka by the [137]Jain monk Somadeva (10th
   century), and in the 11th-century account of Indian [138]culture and
   [139]science Taḥqīq mā li-l-hind by the [140]Muslim scholar
   [141]al-Bīrūnī.

   The Puranas describe various versions of a lamp festival in autumn.
   Although the specifics of the holiday vary in these ancient texts, the
   general sense of the modern five-day Diwali festival and the different
   meanings of the days can be discerned from their accounts. For example,
   multiple Puranas suggest that the lamps are lit in worship of
   [142]Yama, god of the dead, on the day preceding the new moon day,
   which some scholars link with the story of [143]Krishna’s defeat of
   Narakasura (“Hell Demon”) celebrated on this day. The
   Bhavishyottara Purana describes the new moon day (amavasya) as a day of
   festivities, but at midnight the women are said to drive out the
   goddess Alakshmi (“Misfortune”) and propitiate [144]Lakshmi
   (“Fortune”).

Festivities

   Observances of Diwali differ depending on region and tradition. Among
   [146]Hindus the most [147]widespread custom is the lighting of
   [148]diyas (small earthenware lamps filled with oil) on the night of
   the new moon to invite the presence of [149]Lakshmi, the goddess of
   wealth. In [150]Bengal the goddess [151]Kali is worshipped. In northern
   India the festival also celebrates the royal homecoming of [152]Rama
   (along with [153]Sita, Lakshmana, and [154]Hanuman) to the city of
   Ayodhya after defeating [155]Ravana, the 10-headed king of the demons,
   thus connecting the festival with the holiday of [156]Dussehra. In
   southern India the festival marks [157]Krishna’s defeat of the demon
   ([158]asura) Narakasura. Some celebrate Diwali as a commemoration of
   the marriage of Lakshmi and [159]Vishnu, while others observe it as the
   birthday of Lakshmi.

   During the festival, [162]diyas are lit and placed in rows along the
   parapets of temples and houses and set adrift on rivers and streams.
   Homes are decorated, and floors inside and out are covered with
   [163]rangolis, consisting of elaborate designs made of colored rice,
   sand, or flower petals. The doors and windows of houses are kept open
   in the hope that Lakshmi will find her way inside and bless the
   residents with wealth and success.

   The names and events of the individual days of Diwali are as follows:
     * The first day, known as Dhanteras, is dedicated to cleaning homes
       and purchasing small items of gold. Lakshmi and Kubera are the
       focus of worship on that day.
     * The second day, called Naraka Chaturdashi or Choti Diwali,
       [164]commemorates Krishna’s destruction of Narakasura; prayers are
       also offered for the souls of ancestors.
     * On the third day, Lakshmi Puja, families seek blessings from
       Lakshmi to ensure their prosperity; light diyas, candles, and
       fireworks; and visit temples. It is the main day of the Diwali
       festival and occurs on the new moon day.
     * The fourth day, known as Govardhan Puja, Balipratipada, or Annakut,
       commemorates Krishna’s feat of lifting up a mountain, Govardhan
       Hill, to protect the local cowherds in defiance of [165]Indra, the
       king of the gods, who had sent a torrential rain upon them. It is
       also the first day of Karttika and the start of the [166]new year
       in the Vikrama (Hindu) [167]calendar. [168]Merchants perform
       religious ceremonies and open new account books.
     * The fifth day, called Bhai Dooj, Bhai Tika, or Bhai Bij, celebrates
       the bond between brothers and sisters. On that day sisters pray for
       the success and well-being of their brothers, similar to the
       holiday [169]Raksha Bandhan.

   Diwali is generally a time for visiting, exchanging gifts, wearing new
   clothes, feasting, feeding the poor, and setting off fireworks (though
   such displays have been restricted to limit noise and other
   environmental pollution). Gambling, especially in the form of card
   games, is encouraged as a way of ensuring good luck in the coming year
   and in remembrance of the [172]games of dice played by [173]Shiva and
   [174]Parvati on [175]Mount Kailash or similar contests between
   [176]Radha and Krishna. Traditionally, in honor of Lakshmi, the female
   player always wins.

Beyond Hinduism

   Diwali is also an important festival in [179]Jainism. For the Jain
   [180]community, the festival commemorates the enlightenment and
   liberation ([181]moksha) of [182]Mahavira, the most recent of the Jain
   [183]Tirthankaras, from the cycle of life and death ([184]samsara). The
   lighting of the lamps celebrates the light of Mahavira’s holy
   knowledge.

   Since the 18th century, Diwali has been celebrated in [185]Sikhism as
   the time of [186]Guru Hargobind’s return to [187]Amritsar from
   captivity in [188]Gwalior—an echo of Rama’s return to Ayodhya.
