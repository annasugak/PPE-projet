   Light, visible light, or visible radiation is [386]electromagnetic
   radiation that can be [387]perceived by the [388]human
   eye.^[389][1]^[390][2] Visible light spans the [391]visible spectrum
   and is usually defined as having [392]wavelengths in the range of
   400–700 [393]nanometres (nm), corresponding to [394]frequencies of
   750–420 [395]terahertz. The visible band sits adjacent to the
   [396]infrared (with longer wavelengths and lower frequencies) and the
   [397]ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies),
   called collectively [398]optical radiation.^[399][3]^[400][4]

   In [401]physics, the term "light" may refer more broadly to
   electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or
   not.^[402][5]^[403][6] In this sense, [404]gamma rays, [405]X-rays,
   [406]microwaves and [407]radio waves are also light. This is why
   visible radiation is commonly termed visible light.^[408][7]^[409][8]

   The primary properties of light are [410]intensity, propagation
   direction, frequency or wavelength [411]spectrum, and
   [412]polarization. Its [413]speed in vacuum, 299792458 m/s, is one of
   the fundamental [414]constants of nature.^[415][9] All electromagnetic
   radiation exhibits some properties of both [416]particles and waves.
   Single, massless elementary particles, or [417]quanta, of light called
   [418]photons can be detected with specialized equipment; phenomena like
   interference are described by waves. Most everyday interactions with
   light can be understood using [419]geometrical optics. [420]Quantum
   optics is an important research area in [421]modern physics.

   The main source of natural light on Earth is the [422]Sun.
   Historically, another important source of light for humans has been
   [423]fire, from ancient campfires to modern [424]kerosene lamps. With
   the development of [425]electric lights and [426]power systems,
   electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight.

Electromagnetic spectrum and visible light

   [427][500px-EM_spectrum.svg.png] The [428]electromagnetic spectrum,
   with the [429]visible portion highlighted. The bottom graph (Visible
   spectrum) is wavelength in units of nanometres (nm).
   Main article: [430]Electromagnetic spectrum

   Generally, [431]electromagnetic radiation (EMR) is classified by
   wavelength into [432]radio waves, [433]microwaves, [434]infrared, the
   [435]visible spectrum that we perceive as light, [436]ultraviolet,
   [437]X-rays and [438]gamma rays. The designation "[439]radiation"
   excludes [440]static electric, [441]magnetic and [442]near fields.

   The behavior of EMR depends on its wavelength. Higher frequencies have
   shorter wavelengths and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths. When
   EMR interacts with single atoms and molecules, its behavior depends on
   the amount of energy per quantum it carries.

   EMR in the visible light region consists of [443]quanta (called
   [444]photons) that are at the lower end of the energies that are
   capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules, which leads
   to changes in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule. At the lower
   end of the visible light spectrum, EMR becomes invisible to humans
   (infrared) because its photons no longer have enough individual energy
   to cause a lasting molecular change (a change in conformation) in the
   visual molecule [445]retinal in the human retina, which change triggers
   the sensation of vision.

   There exist animals that are sensitive to various types of infrared,
   but not by means of quantum-absorption. [446]Infrared sensing in snakes
   depends on a kind of natural [447]thermal imaging, in which tiny
   packets of cellular water are raised in temperature by the infrared
   radiation. EMR in this range causes molecular vibration and heating
   effects, which is how these animals detect it.

   Above the frequency range of visible light, ultraviolet light becomes
   invisible to humans, mostly because it is absorbed by the cornea with
   wavelengths shorter than 360 [448]nm and the internal lens at
   wavelengths shorter than 400 nm. Furthermore, the [449]rods and
   [450]cones located in the [451]retina of the human eye cannot detect
   the very short (shorter than 360 nm) ultraviolet wavelengths and are in
   fact damaged by ultraviolet. Many animals with eyes that do not require
   lenses (such as insects and shrimp) are able to detect ultraviolet, by
   quantum photon-absorption mechanisms, in much the same chemical way
   that humans detect visible light.

   Various sources define visible light as narrowly as
   420–680 nm^[452][10]^[453][11] to as broadly as
   380–800 nm.^[454][12]^[455][13] Under ideal laboratory conditions,
   people can see infrared up to at least 1,050 nm;^[456][14] children and
   young adults may perceive ultraviolet wavelengths down to about
   310–313 nm.^[457][15]^[458][16]^[459][17]

   Plant growth is also affected by the colour spectrum of light, a
   process known as [460]photomorphogenesis.

Speed of light

   Main article: [461]Speed of light
   [462][250px-Rocca_dell%27Abisso%2C_Fondachelli_Fantina%2C_Sicilia.JPG]
   Beam of sun light inside the cavity of Rocca ill'Abissu at
   [463]Fondachelli-Fantina, Sicily

   The speed of light in [464]vacuum is defined to be exactly
   299792458 m/s (approximately 186,282 miles per second). The fixed value
   of the speed of light in SI units results from the fact that the metre
   is now defined in terms of the speed of light. All forms of
   electromagnetic radiation move at exactly this same speed in vacuum.

   Different [465]physicists have attempted to measure the speed of light
   throughout history. [466]Galileo attempted to measure the speed of
   light in the seventeenth century. An early experiment to measure the
   speed of light was conducted by [467]Ole Rømer, a Danish physicist, in
   1676. Using a [468]telescope, Rømer observed the motions of
   [469]Jupiter and one of its [470]moons, [471]Io. Noting discrepancies
   in the apparent period of Io's orbit, he calculated that light takes
   about 22 minutes to traverse the diameter of Earth's orbit.^[472][18]
   However, its size was not known at that time. If Rømer had known the
   diameter of the Earth's orbit, he would have calculated a speed of
   227000000 m/s.

   Another more accurate measurement of the speed of light was performed
   in Europe by [473]Hippolyte Fizeau in 1849.^[474][19] Fizeau directed a
   beam of light at a mirror several kilometers away. A rotating [475]cog
   wheel was placed in the path of the light beam as it traveled from the
   source, to the mirror and then returned to its origin. Fizeau found
   that at a certain rate of rotation, the beam would pass through one gap
   in the wheel on the way out and the next gap on the way back. Knowing
   the distance to the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel and the
   rate of rotation, Fizeau was able to calculate the speed of light as
   313000000 m/s.

   [476]Léon Foucault carried out an experiment which used rotating
   mirrors to obtain a value of 298000000 m/s^[477][19] in 1862.
   [478]Albert A. Michelson conducted experiments on the speed of light
   from 1877 until his death in 1931. He refined Foucault's methods in
   1926 using improved rotating mirrors to measure the time it took light
   to make a round trip from [479]Mount Wilson to [480]Mount San Antonio
   in California. The precise measurements yielded a speed of
   299796000 m/s.^[481][20]

   The effective velocity of light in various transparent substances
   containing ordinary [482]matter, is less than in vacuum. For example,
   the speed of light in water is about 3/4 of that in vacuum.

   Two independent teams of physicists were said to bring light to a
   "complete standstill" by passing it through a [483]Bose–Einstein
   condensate of the element [484]rubidium, one team at [485]Harvard
   University and the [486]Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge,
   Massachusetts and the other at the [487]Harvard–Smithsonian Center for
   Astrophysics, also in Cambridge.^[488][21] However, the popular
   description of light being "stopped" in these experiments refers only
   to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted
   at an arbitrary later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse.
   During the time it had "stopped", it had ceased to be light.

Optics

   Main article: [489]Optics

   [490][960px-Linear_visible_spectrum.svg.png]

   The study of light and the interaction of light and [491]matter is
   termed [492]optics. Optics has different forms appropriate to different
   circumstances. [493]Geometrical optics, appropriate for understanding
   things like eyes, lenses, cameras, [494]fiber optics, and mirrors,
   works well when the wavelength of light is small in comparison to the
   objects it interacts with. [495]Physical optics incorporates wave
   properties and is needed understand diffraction and interference.
   [496]Quantum optics applies when studying individual photons
   interacting with matter.^[497][22]^: 33 

Surface scattering

   A [498]transparent object allows light to [499]transmit or pass
   through. Conversely, an [500]opaque object does not allow light to
   transmit through and instead [501]reflecting or [502]absorbing the
   light it receives. Most objects do not reflect or transmit light
   [503]specularly and to some degree [504]scatters the incoming light,
   which is called [505]glossiness. Surface scattering is caused by the
   [506]surface roughness of the reflecting surfaces, and internal
   scattering is caused by the difference of [507]refractive index between
   the particles and [508]medium inside the object. Like transparent
   objects, [509]translucent objects allow light to transmit through, but
   translucent objects also scatter certain wavelength of light via
   internal scattering.^[510][23]

Refraction

   Main article: [511]Refraction

   [512][250px-Optical_refraction_at_water_surface.jpg] Due to refraction,
   the straw dipped in water appears bent and the ruler scale compressed
   when viewed from a shallow angle.

   Refraction is the bending of light rays when passing through a surface
   between one transparent material and another. It is described by
   [513]Snell's Law:

   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"> <mstyle

   {\displaystyle n_{1}\sin \theta _{1}=n_{2}\sin \theta _{2}}

   where θ[1] is the angle between the ray and the surface [514]normal in
   the first medium, θ[2] is the angle between the ray and the surface
   normal in the second medium and n[1] and n[2] are the [515]indices of
   refraction, n = 1 in a [516]vacuum and n > 1 in a [517]transparent
   [518]substance.

   When a beam of light crosses the boundary between a vacuum and another
   medium, or between two different media, the wavelength of the light
   changes, but the frequency remains constant. If the beam of light is
   not [519]orthogonal (or rather normal) to the boundary, the change in
   wavelength results in a change in the direction of the beam. This
   change of direction is known as [520]refraction.

   The refractive quality of [521]lenses is frequently used to manipulate
   light in order to change the apparent size of images. [522]Magnifying
   glasses, [523]spectacles, [524]contact lenses, [525]microscopes and
   [526]refracting telescopes are all examples of this manipulation.

Light sources

   "Lightsource" redirects here. For the solar energy developer named
   Lightsource, see [527]Lightsource Renewable Energy. For a particle
   accelerator used to generate X-rays, see [528]Synchrotron light source.

   Further information: [529]List of light sources

   There are many sources of light. A body at a given temperature emits a
   characteristic spectrum of [530]black-body radiation. A simple thermal
   source is [531]sunlight, the radiation emitted by the [532]chromosphere
   of the [533]Sun at around 6,000 [534]K (5,730 [535]°C; 10,340 [536]°F).
   Solar radiation peaks in the visible region of the [537]electromagnetic
   spectrum when plotted in wavelength units,^[538][24] and roughly 44% of
   the radiation that reaches the ground is visible.^[539][25] Another
   example is [540]incandescent light bulbs, which emit only around 10% of
   their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared. A common
   thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in
   [541]flames, but these also emit most of their radiation in the
   infrared and only a fraction in the visible spectrum.

   The peak of the black-body spectrum is in the deep infrared, at about
   10 [542]micrometre wavelength, for relatively cool objects like human
   beings. As the temperature increases, the peak shifts to shorter
   wavelengths, producing first a red glow, then a white one and finally a
   blue-white colour as the peak moves out of the visible part of the
   spectrum and into the ultraviolet. These colours can be seen when metal
   is heated to "red hot" or "white hot". Blue-white [543]thermal emission
   is not often seen, except in stars (the commonly seen pure-blue colour
   in a [544]gas flame or a [545]welder's torch is in fact due to
   molecular emission, notably by CH radicals emitting a wavelength band
   around 425 nm and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation).

   Atoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies. This produces
   "[546]emission lines" in the spectrum of each atom. [547]Emission can
   be [548]spontaneous, as in [549]light-emitting diodes, [550]gas
   discharge lamps (such as [551]neon lamps and [552]neon signs,
   [553]mercury-vapor lamps, etc.) and flames (light from the hot gas
   itself—so, for example, [554]sodium in a gas flame emits characteristic
   yellow light). Emission can also be [555]stimulated, as in a [556]laser
   or a microwave [557]maser.

   Deceleration of a free charged particle, such as an [558]electron, can
   produce visible radiation: [559]cyclotron radiation, [560]synchrotron
   radiation and [561]bremsstrahlung radiation are all examples of this.
   Particles moving through a medium faster than the speed of light in
   that medium can produce visible [562]Cherenkov radiation. Certain
   chemicals produce visible radiation by [563]chemoluminescence. In
   living things, this process is called [564]bioluminescence. For
   example, [565]fireflies produce light by this means and boats moving
   through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake.

   Certain substances produce light when they are illuminated by more
   energetic radiation, a process known as [566]fluorescence. Some
   substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic
   radiation. This is known as [567]phosphorescence. Phosphorescent
   materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic
   particles. [568]Cathodoluminescence is one example. This mechanism is
   used in [569]cathode-ray tube [570]television sets and [571]computer
   monitors.

   illuminated by colourful artificial [574]lighting

   Certain other mechanisms can produce light:
     * [575]Electroluminescence
     * [576]Scintillation
     * [577]Sonoluminescence
     * [578]Triboluminescence

   When the concept of light is intended to include very-high-energy
   photons (gamma rays), additional generation mechanisms include:
     * Particle–[579]antiparticle annihilation
     * [580]Radioactive decay

Measurement

   Main articles: [581]Photometry (optics) and [582]Radiometry

   Light is measured with two main alternative sets of units:
   [583]radiometry consists of measurements of light power at all
   wavelengths, while [584]photometry measures light with wavelength
   weighted with respect to a standardized model of human brightness
   perception. Photometry is useful, for example, to quantify
   [585]Illumination (lighting) intended for human use.

   The photometry units are different from most systems of physical units
   in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light. The
   [586]cone cells in the human eye are of three types which respond
   differently across the visible spectrum and the cumulative response
   peaks at a wavelength of around 555 nm. Therefore, two sources of light
   which produce the same intensity (W/m^2) of visible light do not
   necessarily appear equally bright. The photometry units are designed to
   take this into account and therefore are a better representation of how
   "bright" a light appears to be than raw intensity. They relate to raw
   [587]power by a quantity called [588]luminous efficacy and are used for
   purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination
   for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings. The illumination
   measured by a [589]photocell sensor does not necessarily correspond to
   what is perceived by the human eye and without filters which may be
   costly, photocells and [590]charge-coupled devices (CCD) tend to
   respond to some [591]infrared, [592]ultraviolet or both.

Light pressure

   Main article: [593]Radiation pressure

   Light exerts physical pressure on objects in its path, a phenomenon
   which can be deduced by [594]Maxwell's equations, but can be more
   easily explained by the particle nature of light: photons strike and
   transfer their momentum. Light pressure is equal to the power of the
   light beam divided by [595]c, the speed of light.  Due to the magnitude
   of c, the effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects.
   For example, a one-milliwatt [596]laser pointer exerts a force of about
   3.3 [597]piconewtons on the object being illuminated; thus, one could
   lift a [598]U.S. penny with laser pointers, but doing so would require
   about 30 billion 1-mW laser pointers.^[599][26]  However, in
   [600]nanometre-scale applications such as [601]nanoelectromechanical
   systems (NEMS), the effect of light pressure is more significant and
   exploiting light pressure to drive NEMS mechanisms and to flip
   nanometre-scale physical switches in integrated circuits is an active
   area of research.^[602][27] At larger scales, light pressure can cause
   [603]asteroids to spin faster,^[604][28] acting on their irregular
   shapes as on the vanes of a [605]windmill.  The possibility of making
   [606]solar sails that would accelerate spaceships in space is also
   under investigation.^[607][29]^[608][30]

   Although the motion of the [609]Crookes radiometer was originally
   attributed to light pressure, this interpretation is incorrect; the
   characteristic Crookes rotation is the result of a partial
   vacuum.^[610][31] This should not be confused with the [611]Nichols
   radiometer, in which the (slight) motion caused by torque (though not
   enough for full rotation against friction) is directly caused by light
   pressure.^[612][32] As a consequence of light pressure, [613]Einstein
   in 1909 predicted the existence of "radiation friction" which would
   oppose the movement of matter.^[614][33] He wrote, "radiation will
   exert pressure on both sides of the plate. The forces of pressure
   exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest. However, if
   it is in motion, more radiation will be reflected on the surface that
   is ahead during the motion (front surface) than on the back surface.
   The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is
   thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back. Hence, as
   the resultant of the two forces, there remains a force that counteracts
   the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the
   plate. We will call this resultant 'radiation friction' in brief."

   Usually light momentum is aligned with its direction of motion.
   However, for example in [615]evanescent waves momentum is transverse to
   direction of propagation.^[616][34]

Historical theories about light, in chronological order

Classical Greece and Hellenism

   In the fifth century BC, [617]Empedocles postulated that everything was
   composed of [618]four elements; fire, air, earth and water. He believed
   that goddess [619]Aphrodite made the human eye out of the four elements
   and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye
   making sight possible. If this were true, then one could see during the
   night just as well as during the day, so Empedocles postulated an
   interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as
   the sun.^[620][35]

   In about 300 BC, [621]Euclid wrote Optica, in which he studied the
   properties of light. Euclid postulated that light travelled in straight
   lines and he described the laws of reflection and studied them
   mathematically. He questioned that sight is the result of a beam from
   the eye, for he asks how one sees the stars immediately, if one closes
   one's eyes, then opens them at night. If the beam from the eye travels
   infinitely fast this is not a problem.^[622][36]

   In 55 BC, [623]Lucretius, a Roman who carried on the ideas of earlier
   Greek [624]atomists, wrote that "The light & heat of the sun; these are
   composed of minute atoms which, when they are shoved off, lose no time
   in shooting right across the interspace of air in the direction
   imparted by the shove." (from On the nature of the Universe). Despite
   being similar to later particle theories, Lucretius's views were not
   generally accepted. [625]Ptolemy (c. second century) wrote about the
   [626]refraction of light in his book Optics.^[627][37]

Classical India

   In [628]ancient India, the [629]Hindu schools of [630]Samkhya and
   [631]Vaisheshika, from around the early centuries AD developed theories
   on light. According to the Samkhya school, light is one of the five
   fundamental "subtle" elements (tanmatra) out of which emerge the gross
   elements. The [632]atomicity of these elements is not specifically
   mentioned and it appears that they were actually taken to be
   continuous.^[633][38] The [634]Vishnu Purana refers to sunlight as "the
   seven rays of the sun".^[635][38]

   The Indian [636]Buddhists, such as [637]Dignāga in the fifth century
   and [638]Dharmakirti in the seventh century, developed a type of
   atomism that is a philosophy about reality being composed of atomic
   entities that are momentary flashes of light or energy. They viewed
   light as being an atomic entity equivalent to energy.^[639][38]

Descartes

   [640]René Descartes (1596–1650) held that light was a [641]mechanical
   property of the luminous body, rejecting the "forms" of [642]Ibn
   al-Haytham and [643]Witelo as well as the "species" of [644]Roger
   Bacon, [645]Robert Grosseteste and [646]Johannes Kepler.^[647][39] In
   1637 he published a theory of the [648]refraction of light that
   assumed, incorrectly, that light travelled faster in a denser medium
   than in a less dense medium. Descartes arrived at this conclusion by
   analogy with the behaviour of sound waves.^[[649]citation needed]
   Although Descartes was incorrect about the relative speeds, he was
   correct in assuming that light behaved like a wave and in concluding
   that refraction could be explained by the speed of light in different
   media.

   Descartes is not the first to use the mechanical analogies but because
   he clearly asserts that light is only a mechanical property of the
   luminous body and the transmitting medium, Descartes's theory of light
   is regarded as the start of modern physical optics.^[650][39]

Particle theory

   Main article: [651]Corpuscular theory of light

   [652][250px-PierreGassendi.jpg] [653]Pierre Gassendi

   [654]Pierre Gassendi (1592–1655), an atomist, proposed a particle
   theory of light which was published posthumously in the 1660s.
   [655]Isaac Newton studied Gassendi's work at an early age and preferred
   his view to Descartes's theory of the plenum. He stated in his
   Hypothesis of Light of 1675 that light was composed of [656]corpuscles
   (particles of matter) which were emitted in all directions from a
   source. One of Newton's arguments against the wave nature of light was
   that waves were known to bend around obstacles, while light travelled
   only in straight lines. He did, however, explain the phenomenon of the
   [657]diffraction of light (which had been observed by [658]Francesco
   Grimaldi) by allowing that a light particle could create a localised
   wave in the [659]aether.

   Newton's theory could be used to predict the [660]reflection of light,
   but could only explain [661]refraction by incorrectly assuming that
   light accelerated upon entering a denser [662]medium because the
   [663]gravitational pull was greater. Newton published the final version
   of his theory in his [664]Opticks of 1704. His reputation helped the
   [665]particle theory of light to hold sway during the eighteenth
   century. The particle theory of light led [666]Pierre-Simon Laplace to
   argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from
   it. In other words, it would become what is now called a [667]black
   hole. Laplace withdrew his suggestion later, after a wave theory of
   light became firmly established as the model for light (as has been
   explained, neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct). A
   translation of Newton's essay on light appears in The large scale
   structure of space-time, by [668]Stephen Hawking and [669]George F. R.
   Ellis.

   The fact that light could be [670]polarized was for the first time
   qualitatively explained by Newton using the particle theory.
   [671]Étienne-Louis Malus in 1810 created a mathematical particle theory
   of polarization. [672]Jean-Baptiste Biot in 1812 showed that this
   theory explained all known phenomena of light polarization. At that
   time the polarization was considered as the proof of the particle
   theory.

Wave theory

   To explain the origin of [673]colours, [674]Robert Hooke (1635–1703)
   developed a "pulse theory" and compared the spreading of light to that
   of waves in water in his 1665 work [675]Micrographia ("Observation
   IX"). In 1672 Hooke suggested that light's vibrations could be
   [676]perpendicular to the direction of propagation. [677]Christiaan
   Huygens (1629–1695) worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in
   1678 and published it in his [678]Treatise on Light in 1690. He
   proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves
   in a medium called the [679]luminiferous aether. As waves are not
   affected by gravity, it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering
   a denser medium.^[680][40] Another supporter of the wave theory was
   [681]Leonhard Euler. He argued in Nova theoria lucis et colorum (1746)
   that [682]diffraction could more easily be explained by a wave theory.
   [683][250px-Christiaan_Huygens-painting.jpeg] [684]Christiaan
   Huygens[685][250px-Young_Diffraction.png] [686]Thomas Young's sketch of
   water waves showing [687]diffraction^[688][41]

   The wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each
   other like sound waves (as noted around 1800 by [689]Thomas Young).
   Young showed by means of numerous [690]diffraction experiments that
   light behaved as waves.^[691][42]^: 101  He first publicly stated his
   "general law" of interference in January 1802, in his book A Syllabus
   of a Course of Lectures on Natural and Experimental
   Philosophy:^[692][43]

     But the general law, by which all these appearances are governed,
     may be very easily deduced from the interference of two coincident
     undulations, which either cooperate, or destroy each other, in the
     same manner as two musical notes produce an alternate intension and
     remission, in the beating of an imperfect unison.^[693][44]

   He also proposed that different colours were caused by different
   [694]wavelengths of light and explained colour vision in terms of
   three-coloured receptors in the eye.

   In 1816 [695]André-Marie Ampère gave [696]Augustin-Jean Fresnel an idea
   that the polarization of light can be explained by the wave theory if
   light were a [697]transverse wave.^[698][45] Later, Fresnel
   independently worked out his own wave theory of light and presented it
   to the [699]Académie des Sciences in 1817. [700]Siméon Denis Poisson
   challenged Fresnel's model, claiming that it predicted a bright spot in
   the shadow behind a circular obstacle contrary to common sense.
   [701]Dominique-François-Jean Arago created an experiment that showed
   the [702]bright spot: Poisson's challenge became new evidence for the
   wave theory.^[703][42]^: 109  In 1818, Young wrote to Arago suggesting
   that light must be transverse waves, not the longitudinal waves
   characteristic of sound. Fresnel took up the idea and was able to show
   via mathematical methods that polarization could be explained by a
   transverse wave theory of light with no longitudinal
   vibration.^[704][42]^: 115 

   The weakness of the wave theory was that light waves, like sound waves,
   would need a medium for transmission. The existence of the hypothetical
   substance [705]luminiferous aether proposed by Huygens in 1678 was cast
   into strong doubt in the late nineteenth century by the
   [706]Michelson–Morley experiment.

   Newton's [707]corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster
   in a denser medium, while the wave theory of Huygens and others implied
   the opposite. At that time, the [708]speed of light could not be
   measured accurately enough to decide which theory was correct. The
   first to make a sufficiently accurate measurement was [709]Léon
   Foucault, in 1850.^[710][46] His result supported the wave theory, and
   the classical particle theory was finally abandoned (only to partly
   re-emerge in the twentieth century as [711]photons in [712]quantum
   theory).

Electromagnetic theory

   Main article: [713]Electromagnetic radiation

   [714][500px-Onde_electromagnetique.svg.png] A [715]linearly polarized
   electromagnetic wave traveling along the z-axis, with E denoting the
   [716]electric field and perpendicular B denoting [717]magnetic field

   In 1845, [718]Michael Faraday discovered that the plane of polarization
   of linearly polarized light is rotated when the light rays travel along
   the [719]magnetic field direction in the presence of a transparent
   [720]dielectric, an effect now known as [721]Faraday
   rotation.^[722][47] This was the first evidence that light was related
   to [723]electromagnetism. In 1846 he speculated that light might be
   some form of disturbance propagating along magnetic field
   lines.^[724][47] Faraday proposed in 1847 that light was a
   high-frequency electromagnetic vibration, which could propagate even in
   the absence of a medium such as the ether.^[725][48]

   Faraday's work inspired [726]James Clerk Maxwell to study
   electromagnetic radiation and light. Maxwell discovered that
   self-propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a
   constant speed, which happened to be equal to the previously measured
   speed of light. From this, Maxwell concluded that light was a form of
   electromagnetic radiation: he first stated this result in 1862 in On
   Physical Lines of Force. In 1873, he published [727]A Treatise on
   Electricity and Magnetism, which contained a full mathematical
   description of the behavior of electric and magnetic fields, still
   known as [728]Maxwell's equations. Soon after, [729]Heinrich Hertz
   confirmed Maxwell's theory experimentally by generating and detecting
   radio waves in the laboratory and demonstrating that these waves
   behaved exactly like visible light, exhibiting properties such as
   reflection, refraction, diffraction and [730]interference. Maxwell's
   theory and Hertz's experiments led directly to the development of
   modern radio, radar, television, electromagnetic imaging and wireless
   communications.

   In the quantum theory, photons are seen as [731]wave packets of the
   waves described in the classical theory of Maxwell. The quantum theory
   was needed to explain effects even with visual light that Maxwell's
   classical theory could not (such as [732]spectral lines).

Quantum theory

   In 1900 [733]Max Planck, attempting to explain [734]black-body
   radiation, suggested that although light was a wave, these waves could
   gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency.
   Planck called these "lumps" of light energy "[735]quanta" (from a Latin
   word for "how much"). In 1905, Albert Einstein used the idea of light
   quanta to explain the [736]photoelectric effect and suggested that
   these light quanta had a "real" existence. In 1923 [737]Arthur Holly
   Compton showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity X-rays
   scattered from electrons (so called [738]Compton scattering) could be
   explained by a particle-theory of X-rays, but not a wave theory. In
   1926 [739]Gilbert N. Lewis named these light quanta particles
   [740]photons.^[741][49]

   Eventually [742]quantum mechanics came to picture light as (in some
   sense) both a particle and a wave, and (in another sense) as a
   phenomenon which is neither a particle nor a wave (which actually are
   macroscopic phenomena, such as baseballs or ocean waves). Instead,
   under some approximations light can be described sometimes with
   mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor (particles)
   and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor (waves).

   As in the case for radio waves and the X-rays involved in Compton
   scattering, physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends
   to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies, but more
   like a classical particle at higher frequencies, but never completely
   loses all qualities of one or the other. Visible light, which occupies
   a middle ground in frequency, can easily be shown in experiments to be
   describable using either a wave or particle model, or sometimes both.

   In 1924–1925, [743]Satyendra Nath Bose showed that light followed
   different statistics from that of classical particles. With Einstein,
   they generalized this result for a whole set of integer spin particles
   called [744]bosons (after Bose) that follow [745]Bose–Einstein
   statistics. The photon is a massless boson of [746]spin 1.

   In 1927, [747]Paul Dirac quantized the [748]electromagnetic field.
   [749]Pascual Jordan and [750]Vladimir Fock generalized this process to
   treat many-body systems as excitations of quantum fields, a process
   with the misnomer of [751]second quantization. And at the end of the
   1940s a full theory of [752]quantum electrodynamics was developed using
   quantum fields based on the works of [753]Julian Schwinger,
   [754]Richard Feynman, [755]Freeman Dyson, and [756]Shinichiro Tomonaga.

Quantum optics

   Main article: [757]Quantum optics

   [758]John R. Klauder, [759]George Sudarshan, [760]Roy J. Glauber, and
   [761]Leonard Mandel applied quantum theory to the electromagnetic field
   in the 1950s and 1960s to gain a more detailed understanding of
   photodetection and the [762]statistics of light (see [763]degree of
   coherence). This led to the introduction of the [764]coherent state as
   a concept which addressed variations between laser light, thermal
   light, exotic [765]squeezed states, etc. as it became understood that
   light cannot be fully described just referring to the
   [766]electromagnetic fields describing the waves in the classical
   picture. In 1977, [767]H. Jeff Kimble et al. demonstrated a single atom
   emitting one photon at a time, further compelling evidence that light
   consists of photons. Previously unknown quantum states of light with
   characteristics unlike classical states, such as [768]squeezed light
   were subsequently discovered.

   Development of short and [769]ultrashort laser pulses—created by [770]Q
   switching and [771]modelocking techniques—opened the way to the study
   of what became known as ultrafast processes. Applications for solid
   state research (e.g. [772]Raman spectroscopy) were found, and
   mechanical forces of light on matter were studied. The latter led to
   levitating and positioning clouds of atoms or even small biological
   samples in an [773]optical trap or [774]optical tweezers by laser beam.
   This, along with [775]Doppler cooling and [776]Sisyphus cooling, was
   the crucial technology needed to achieve the celebrated
   [777]Bose–Einstein condensation.

   Other remarkable results are the [778]demonstration of quantum
   entanglement, [779]quantum teleportation, and [780]quantum logic gates.
   The latter are of much interest in [781]quantum information theory, a
   subject which partly emerged from quantum optics, partly from
   theoretical [782]computer science.

Use for light on Earth

   [783]Sunlight provides the [784]energy that [785]green plants use to
   create [786]sugars mostly in the form of [787]starches, which release
   energy into the living things that digest them. This process of
   [788]photosynthesis provides virtually all the energy used by living
   things. Some species of animals generate their own light, a process
   called [789]bioluminescence. For example, [790]fireflies use light to
   locate mates and [791]vampire squid use it to hide themselves from
   prey.
