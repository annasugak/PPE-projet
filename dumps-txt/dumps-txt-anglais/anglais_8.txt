       How to Heal a Family Split
       Cut-offs cut deep and wide, their emotional impact reverberating
       far beyond the combatants. Because much of the suffering is hidden,
       repair is challenging for everyone, not least of all therapists.

   On Having Fun

Play

Lighthearted. Light, As In The Light That Lights The Heart

Light, as in unencumbered. Weightless, as in free.

   Lighthearted. Yes, yes. One of my favorite phrases. Light, as in the
   light that lights the heart and the world. Light, as in unencumbered.
   Weightless. As in free.

   As both Merriam and Webster so clearly define,

   Definition of lighthearted

   1: free from care, anxiety, or seriousness: happy-go-lucky a
   lighthearted mood

   2: cheerfully optimistic and hopeful: easygoing they can be
   lighthearted in the midst of misery — H. J. Forman

   lightheartedly

   adverb

   lightheartedness

   noun

   Lighthearted:

   free from care, anxiety, or seriousness: happy-go-lucky

   cheerfully optimistic and hopeful: easygoing

   When you're with friends, maybe even neighbors, and the invitation to
   play is just that - an invitation. And everybody is there for no other
   reason than to have fun together. You become lighthearted. And the
   light of your lighthearted heart is shared. A weight is lifted. A
   separation healed. A connection made visible.

   It becomes a light that illuminates everything.

   You feel a certain trust in each other, a certain certainty. People are
   there because they want to be. They want to play together. And when
   someone for some reason doesn't want to play, it's as valid a response
   to the invitation as playing is.

   Any question about this being a good use of time is answered by the fun
   people are having.

   The relevance of it all, to you and to the community, is everywhere
   manifest. You are each having fun together. No further explanation
   needed.

   The value to yourself and to the community is self-evident, every
   moment of every game, even when all you're doing is watching, or
   hanging out in the kitchen talking. It's freedom, is what it is. It's
   community. It's, well, like being in love with people who love you, so
   to speak, in a way.

   And because the kids are around, you're feeling all that without drugs,
   without alcohol even. So nothing can come between you and the
   authenticity of your experience. It's really you. Really them. It's
   magic, is what it is, this shared light, this heart. The fun of it all
   is so much more encompassing simply because you're doing it freely,
   together, in full consciousness, wholeheartedly and wholebodily.

   This is the way it is when you come together to for fun.

   You let loose. You let the light of being together into your very
   heart. You let the fun in. You let each other in.

   Laughing hearts. Loving hearts. Light hearts. Much, very much, to the
   delight of all.
