   What is Diwali?

   Diwali, also spelled Divali, is one of the major religious festivals in
   Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism. The name is derived from the Sanskrit
   term dipavali, meaning “row of lights.” The festival generally
   symbolizes the victory of light over darkness.

   Which religions celebrate Diwali?

   Diwali is one of the major religious festivals in Hinduism, Jainism,
   and Sikhism. Although not a primary festival of Buddhism, Diwali is
   celebrated by some Buddhists as a commemoration of the day when Emperor
   Ashoka converted to Buddhism in the 3rd century bce.

   Do Sikhs celebrate Diwali?

   Since the 18th century, Diwali has been celebrated in Sikhism as the
   time of Guru Hargobind’s return to Amritsar from captivity in Gwalior,
   an echo of Rama’s return to Ayodhya. Residents of Amritsar lit lamps
   throughout the city to celebrate the occasion.

   Do Jains celebrate Diwali?

   Diwali is an important festival in Jainism. For the Jain community, the
   festival commemorates the enlightenment and liberation (moksha) of
   Mahavira, the most recent of the Jain Tirthankaras, from the cycle of
   life and death (samsara). The lighting of the lamps celebrates the
   light of Mahavira’s holy knowledge.

   How is Diwali celebrated?

   People celebrate Diwali differently depending on region and tradition.
   Hindus light diyas (earthenware lamps) on the new moon night to honor
   Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. People exchange gifts, wear new
   clothes, feast, feed the poor, and set off fireworks (though these are
   now restricted to curb pollution).

   Diwali, one of the major religious festivals in Hinduism, Jainism, and
   Sikhism, lasting for five days from the 13th day of the dark half of
   the lunar month Ashvina to the second day of the light half of the
   lunar month Karttika. (The corresponding dates in the Gregorian
   calendar usually fall in late October and November.) The name is
   derived from the Sanskrit term dipavali, meaning “row of lights.” The
   festival generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness.

History

   Diwali developed over centuries from local traditions that occur on the
   days surrounding the new moon day of Karttika. The most ancient mention
   of the holiday can be found in the Kamasutra of Vatsyayana (3rd century
   ce). In that instance it is called Yaksharatri, or night of yakshas
   (nature spirits led by Kubera, the god of wealth). The Puranas
   (400–1500) provide the most comprehensive picture of Diwali, but the
   festival is also mentioned in other sources, such as in the local
   Purana from Kashmir called Nilamata Purana (c. 7th century), in the
   Yashastilaka by the Jain monk Somadeva (10th century), and in the
   11th-century account of Indian culture and science Taḥqīq mā li-l-hind
   by the Muslim scholar al-Bīrūnī.

   The Puranas describe various versions of a lamp festival in autumn.
   Although the specifics of the holiday vary in these ancient texts, the
   general sense of the modern five-day Diwali festival and the different
   meanings of the days can be discerned from their accounts. For example,
   multiple Puranas suggest that the lamps are lit in worship of Yama, god
   of the dead, on the day preceding the new moon day, which some scholars
   link with the story of Krishna’s defeat of Narakasura (“Hell Demon”)
   celebrated on this day. The Bhavishyottara Purana describes the new
   moon day (amavasya) as a day of festivities, but at midnight the women
   are said to drive out the goddess Alakshmi (“Misfortune”) and
   propitiate Lakshmi (“Fortune”).

Festivities

   Observances of Diwali differ depending on region and tradition. Among
   Hindus the most widespread custom is the lighting of diyas (small
   earthenware lamps filled with oil) on the night of the new moon to
   invite the presence of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. In Bengal the
   goddess Kali is worshipped. In northern India the festival also
   celebrates the royal homecoming of Rama (along with Sita, Lakshmana,
   and Hanuman) to the city of Ayodhya after defeating Ravana, the
   10-headed king of the demons, thus connecting the festival with the
   holiday of Dussehra. In southern India the festival marks Krishna’s
   defeat of the demon (asura) Narakasura. Some celebrate Diwali as a
   commemoration of the marriage of Lakshmi and Vishnu, while others
   observe it as the birthday of Lakshmi.

   During the festival, diyas are lit and placed in rows along the
   parapets of temples and houses and set adrift on rivers and streams.
   Homes are decorated, and floors inside and out are covered with
   rangolis, consisting of elaborate designs made of colored rice, sand,
   or flower petals. The doors and windows of houses are kept open in the
   hope that Lakshmi will find her way inside and bless the residents with
   wealth and success.

   The names and events of the individual days of Diwali are as follows:
     * The first day, known as Dhanteras, is dedicated to cleaning homes
       and purchasing small items of gold. Lakshmi and Kubera are the
       focus of worship on that day.
     * The second day, called Naraka Chaturdashi or Choti Diwali,
       commemorates Krishna’s destruction of Narakasura; prayers are also
       offered for the souls of ancestors.
     * On the third day, Lakshmi Puja, families seek blessings from
       Lakshmi to ensure their prosperity; light diyas, candles, and
       fireworks; and visit temples. It is the main day of the Diwali
       festival and occurs on the new moon day.
     * The fourth day, known as Govardhan Puja, Balipratipada, or Annakut,
       commemorates Krishna’s feat of lifting up a mountain, Govardhan
       Hill, to protect the local cowherds in defiance of Indra, the king
       of the gods, who had sent a torrential rain upon them. It is also
       the first day of Karttika and the start of the new year in the
       Vikrama (Hindu) calendar. Merchants perform religious ceremonies
       and open new account books.
     * The fifth day, called Bhai Dooj, Bhai Tika, or Bhai Bij, celebrates
       the bond between brothers and sisters. On that day sisters pray for
       the success and well-being of their brothers, similar to the
       holiday Raksha Bandhan.

   Diwali is generally a time for visiting, exchanging gifts, wearing new
   clothes, feasting, feeding the poor, and setting off fireworks (though
   such displays have been restricted to limit noise and other
   environmental pollution). Gambling, especially in the form of card
   games, is encouraged as a way of ensuring good luck in the coming year
   and in remembrance of the games of dice played by Shiva and Parvati on
   Mount Kailash or similar contests between Radha and Krishna.
   Traditionally, in honor of Lakshmi, the female player always wins.
