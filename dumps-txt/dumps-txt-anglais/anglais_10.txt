What is a light-year?

   Light-year is the distance light travels in one year. Light zips
   through interstellar space at 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per
   second and 5.88 trillion miles (9.46 trillion kilometers) per year.

   NASA/JPL-Caltech.

   We use light-time to measure the vast distances of space.

   It’s the distance that light travels in a specific period of time.
   Also: LIGHT IS FAST, nothing travels faster than light.

   How far can light travel in one minute? 11,160,000 miles. It takes 43.2
   minutes for sunlight to reach Jupiter, about 484 million miles away.
   Light is fast, but the distances are vast. In an hour, light can travel
   671 million miles.

   Earth is about eight light minutes from the Sun. A trip at light-speed
   to the very edge of our solar system – the farthest reaches of the Oort
   Cloud, a collection of dormant comets way, way out there – would take
   about 1.87 years. Keep going to Proxima Centauri, our nearest
   neighboring star, and plan on arriving in 4.25 years at light speed.

   When we talk about the enormity of the cosmos, it’s easy to toss out
   big numbers – but far more difficult to wrap our minds around just how
   large, how far, and how numerous celestial bodies really are.

   To get a better sense, for instance, of the true distances to
   exoplanets – planets around other stars – we might start with the
   theater in which we find them, the Milky Way galaxy.

   Our galaxy is a gravitationally bound collection of stars, swirling in
   a spiral through space. Based on the deepest images obtained so far,
   it’s one of about 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe.
   Groups of them are bound into clusters of galaxies, and these into
   superclusters; the superclusters are arranged in immense sheets
   stretching across the universe, interspersed with dark voids and
   lending the whole a kind of spiderweb structure. Our galaxy probably
   contains 100 to 400 billion stars, and is about 100,000 light-years
   across. That sounds huge, and it is, at least until we start comparing
   it to other galaxies. Our neighboring Andromeda galaxy, for example, is
   some 220,000 light-years wide. Another galaxy, IC 1101, spans as much
   as 4 million light-years.

   Based on observations by NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope, we can
   confidently predict that every star you see in the sky probably hosts
   at least one planet. Realistically, we’re most likely talking about
   multi-planet systems rather than just single planets. In our galaxy of
   hundreds of billions of stars, this pushes the number of planets
   potentially into the trillions. Confirmed exoplanet detections (made by
   Kepler and other telescopes, both in space and on the ground) now come
   to more than 4,000 – and that’s from looking at only tiny slices of our
   galaxy. Many of these are small, rocky worlds that might be at the
   right temperature for liquid water to pool on their surfaces.

   The nearest-known exoplanet is a small, probably rocky planet orbiting
   Proxima Centauri – the next star over from Earth. A little more than
   four light-years away, or 24 trillion miles. If an airline offered a
   flight there by jet, it would take 5 million years. Not much is known
   about this world; its close orbit and the periodic flaring of its star
   lower its chances of being habitable.

   The TRAPPIST-1 system is seven planets, all roughly in Earth’s size
   range, orbiting a red dwarf star about 40 light-years away. They are
   very likely rocky, with four in the “habitable zone” – the orbital
   distance allowing potential liquid water on the surface. And computer
   modeling shows some have a good chance of being watery – or icy –
   worlds. In the next few years, we might learn whether they have
   atmospheres or oceans, or even signs of habitability.

   One of the most distant exoplanets known to us in the Milky Way is
   Kepler-443 b. Traveling at light speed, it would take 3,000 years to
   get there. Or 28 billion years, going 60 mph.
