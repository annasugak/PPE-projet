Eating and Drinking After Bowel Surgery

   Please note, this page is printable by selecting the normal print
   options on your computer.

   What to eat after bowel surgery:
   After you have had bowel surgery your doctor/surgeon will advise you
   when you can start eating and drinking again. It is usual to start with
   drinking fluids only, and then to gradually progress to eating food.
   The time taken for your bowel to recover after surgery, and for you to
   then start eating and drinking again will vary between different people
   and will also depend on which bowel surgery you have had. If you are on
   the Enhanced Recovery Programme, you will be drinking fluids and
   building up your diet relatively quickly, within 2-3 days of your
   surgery. Depending on which bowel surgery you have had, your
   doctor/surgeon will advise you how quickly you can build up your diet
   and progress through the stages listed below. When you are allowed to
   start eating again, it is recommended to start with small amounts of
   soft, low fibre, lower fat foods that are easy to digest. This is
   called a ‘Light Diet’.

   Stages to building up your diet after bowel surgery:

   Stage 1) Clear fluids: water, weak squash, weak black tea, clear soup
   (Bovril drink), jelly To start with you may be advised to take small
   ‘sips’ of clear fluids through the day

   Stage 2) Free fluids: smooth fruit juice, milk and milky drinks such as
   hot chocolate and milkshakes (‘Meritene’ milkshakes and ‘Ensure Plus’
   milkshakes are available on the ward)

   Stage 3) Light Diet: small portions of low fibre, soft foods. See table
   below for suitable food options. The Light Diet will help your bowel
   recover after your surgery, and gradually get it used to digesting food
   again. The Light Diet is a temporary diet to follow after you have had
   bowel surgery. Generally you can aim to build up to your usual diet
   again within 2-6 weeks of your surgery. So once you are managing the
   Light Diet well, you can continue to reintroduce foods and build up to
   your usual diet again over the following weeks.

   Stage 4) Normal diet: continue to build up your intake gradually and
   aim to return to your normal diet.

   Top tips for building up your diet:
    Have small, frequent meals and snacks as your bowel adapts.
    Eating regularly through the day will help to encourage a regular
   bowel habit.
    Drink plenty of fluids, especially if you have diarrhoea.
    Include protein foods such as meat, fish, eggs, cheese and milk in at
   least 2 meals per day;
   this will help the healing process after surgery.
    Continue to reintroduce foods gradually over the weeks following your
   surgery.
