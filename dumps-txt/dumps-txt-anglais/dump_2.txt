Chasing the Aurora Borealis

   Hordes of tourists are flocking to the Arctic in search of the elusive
   glow—which often looks more spectacular on Instagram than in reality.

   On January 31, 1913, King Haakon VII of Norway went to the University
   of Oslo to hear a lecture by the physicist Kristian Birkeland, who
   believed that he had unlocked the secrets of the aurora borealis, also
   known as the northern lights. Birkeland planned to demonstrate his
   theory with the aid of a specially constructed device: a brass-plated
   magnetic sphere, called a terrella, suspended inside a vacuum chamber
   with glass sides and an electrode on one end. When the electrode was
   heated, it would shoot cathode rays across the chamber toward the
   sphere. If all went well, the rays would interact with the sphere’s
   magnetic field, producing eerie flashes of light that replicated, in
   miniature, the aurora borealis.

   As Birkeland’s biographer Lucy Jago tells it, the lecture was a
   triumph. The contraption didn’t electrocute anybody or implode in
   splinters of flying glass, as earlier models had tended to do, and
   obligingly produced a diminutive version of the aurora’s luminous flux,
   dazzling the King. Word spread, and a Nobel Prize was widely predicted,
   yet England’s Royal Society—at the time the arbiter of scientific
   fact—was unimpressed, and treated Birkeland as an amateur with a
   hopelessly inadequate grasp of theoretical physics. He died in 1917,
   and it wasn’t until the nineteen-sixties that satellite data proved his
   hypothesis to be correct. The lights are caused by high-velocity solar
   particles—the “solar wind,” as it came to be called—interacting with
   the Earth’s magnetic field and atmosphere.

   Birkeland remains underappreciated, but his imprint can be felt in the
   mixture of engineering wizardry and primal enchantment that is fuelling
   a touristic boom in countries where the northern lights appear. As I
   discovered on a trip to the Arctic in February, the glow of an aurora
   is sometimes difficult to perceive with the naked eye, and travellers
   often must engage in a form of technologically enhanced rapture.

   The best chances of seeing the lights are in the elliptical area known
   as the Auroral Oval, which is centered on geomagnetic north. The
   Earth’s magnetic field becomes almost perpendicular to its surface
   here, drawing the solar particles into the atmosphere. Much of Siberia
   falls within the zone, but I decided to visit northern Scandinavia,
   where the art of maintaining extreme comfort in the face of extreme
   cold seemed likely to be more advanced. Among the region’s more
   tempting accommodations are the glass-igloo hotels of Finland, where
   you can simply lie back and watch the show in bed.

   I stayed at a newish igloo hotel, the Aurora Village, near the town of
   Ivalo, in the far north of the country. It sounded more appealing than
   the much Instagrammed original, in Kakslauttanen, having fewer igloos
   and no Santa’s Home on the compound. I arrived late, exhausted from the
   knock-on effects of a cancelled flight. The hotel’s twenty-eight Aurora
   Cabins, set around a large reindeer paddock, looked like quaint log
   huts from the front, with twenty inches of moonlit snow on the eaves.
   Inside, the rustic gave way to the futuristic. A glass-panelled dome
   loomed over the north-facing end of a single room, with luxe bedding
   and a complimentary drinks tray arranged below, like the furnishings of
   a tastefully debauched starship. Slipping under a reindeer-fur
   coverlet, I found myself facing the first conundrum of northern-lights
   tourism, which is that the more comfortable your viewing situation the
   more likely you are to be insensate when the lights appear. I was eager
   to see them, naturally, but not obsessed. I had a whole week, and, from
   what I’d read, at the time of my visit there were good odds for a
   display on most nights. With this comforting thought, I fell asleep.

   You can be woken in the middle of the night if you wish—and there are
   apps that will rouse you at the right moment—but you can’t do anything
   about cloudy skies or daylight. (The phenomenon that produces the
   lights can occur at any hour.) For the tourist, the question arises:
   what do you do when there’s no prospect of seeing the lights, which is
   much of the time? The answer is activities, although “safari” is the
   perversely tropical term of choice: you can go on a reindeer safari, a
   husky safari, an ice-fishing safari, a snowmobile safari, a king-crab
   safari. I talked to the activities manager at the Aurora Village,
   Abraham Montes, over breakfast in the resort’s dining hall—a conical
   structure made of spruce planks—and it became clear that his job had as
   much to do with managing expectations as activities. “The first thing
   people ask is ‘What time does the aurora begin?’ ” he told me. He was
   exaggerating, but only a bit; in recent years, he acknowledged,
   tourists have become increasingly fixated on the goal of catching a
   brilliant display. Montes hedged against their disappointment by
   recommending at least one activity a day. In addition to the safaris,
   you could visit a sauna, or go on a cultural excursion called the
   Authentic Sámi Experience, in which native Laplanders welcome guests
   into a lávvu, a tepee-like shelter, and sing traditional songs around a
   fire.

   I joined an ice-fishing safari that Montes was leading. We climbed into
   a covered sled with portholes, and zipped out onto a frozen river
   nearby. A cutting wind blew across the ice, and I was glad of the day
   that I’d spent in New Jersey malls, buying advanced thermal gear. With
   me was a German couple, who seemed serious about the fishing, and a
   Malaysian family, with a young daughter, who’d come to Finland because
   the lights were on their bucket list—a term that has gone global.
   Montes showed us how to drill holes with an auger, and baited our hooks
   with plastic worms. (He’d planned to use real ones, but they had frozen
   during the night.) The fishing rods seemed absurdly short and bendy,
   like something that you might use to win a prize at an amusement park.
   We squatted at our holes, dipping and raising as instructed. The flat
   landscape around us was more built up than I’d expected this far north,
   but pleasant enough under the fresh snow, with the wide sky showing
   different pinks and yellows every time you looked at it. Now and then,
   dogsleds carrying tourists hurtled by; each time, we laboriously took
   off our mittens and glove liners and rummaged for our phones, in order
   to take photographs.

   I asked Montes what role social media had played in northern-lights
   tourism, and he gave an exasperated laugh. The Ivalo hotel was
   constantly being approached by YouTubers and Instagram influencers who
   offered publicity in return for free accommodations. “It’s hard to
   calculate the benefits, but they post pictures, and it’s good for us to
   have people know there are glass igloos beyond Kakslauttanen, so
   sometimes we say yes,” he said. “We just had two of them staying, with
   five hundred thousand followers each. They wanted free rooms—free
   everything.” He mentioned a [22]2012 BuzzFeed article on the
   Kakslauttanen igloos, citing it as a pivotal event in the aurora
   industry. It was published on the eve of a “solar maximum,” a high
   point in the eleven-year cycle of solar activity, and many people who
   visited the Arctic soon afterward were treated to glorious displays.
   The article also coincided with Instagram’s drift from cats and food to
   landscapes and natural phenomena. “The image of those igloos was
   suddenly everywhere,” Montes said. We were nearing the low point in the
   solar cycle now, he noted, though he assured me that the lights could
   still be thrilling, adding, “You just have to be lucky.”

   The Germans were looking a little frustrated by their ice hole, and I
   got the feeling that we weren’t presenting much of a threat to the pike
   and grayling allegedly massing below us. Nobody caught anything. We
   headed back to the hotel, where I ate a bowl of spaghetti with a
   reindeer Bolognese sauce. I returned outside for a happy few hours of
   cross-country skiing. That evening, the forecast apps suggested that I
   had a less than twenty-per-cent chance of seeing an aurora. It didn’t
   seem worth mounting a vigil, and once again I fell guiltily,
   expensively asleep.

   Something woke me at three. Groggy and myopic, I caught a promising
   green blur overhead and grabbed my glasses. The color of an aurora
   depends on which atmospheric gases are being pelted by solar particles.
   Oxygen emits a greenish hue and, occasionally, red; nitrogen emits
   violet and blue. In this case, the green turned out to be emitted by a
   light on the thermostat—its glow was reflected in the glass dome.
   Nevertheless, the sky had cleared, and the stars glittered promisingly
   above the snow-gloved spruce trees. I stared up for a while. Gazing at
   the sky at 3 a.m., however, in the hope of being granted a vision of
   dancing emerald lights is an activity that quickly starts to feel
   absurd, even delusional, and I soon passed out again. In the morning, I
   learned that I hadn’t missed anything.

   Over the years, I’ve sampled some extravagant framings of natural
   wonders: a helicopter ride into the Grand Canyon; orcas seen from a
   hydrofoil in Puget Sound. I have some puritanical distrust of good
   things being handed to one on a plate, but I can’t pretend that I
   haven’t enjoyed these adventures. In those cases, the fun was partly
   about comfort, but it was also about the feeling of accelerated
   gratification. My igloo was extremely comfortable, but it lacked that
   crucial element of being able to speed things along. You need just as
   much patience in a glass igloo as you do in a motel.

   I went a bit farther north, to the vast frozen lake of Inari, where the
   lack of light pollution supposedly raises the chances of seeing the
   lights. Here, as everywhere, my hotel was packed: tour buses and
   S.U.V.s lined the parking lot. Guests in puffer jackets were riding
   fatbikes on the ice. Inside, at the buffet, they piled plates with
   sautéed reindeer and lingonberries. The Activities Book at the front
   desk offered the usual excursions, along with a Lappish Dinner
   featuring “a real Sámi person.” I signed up for Aurora Camp, which
   promised warm drinks “while waiting for the sky to show its magic.” I
   liked the confidence of the description; it made the magic sound more
   like a scheduled event than like a mere hope. Fiat lux.

   At eight o’clock, a dozen other campers and I were issued stiff
   blue-and-black snowsuits that turned us into identical Lego people. A
   snowmobile towed us across the lake in a train of open sleds. Once we
   were on the other side, a guide lit a fire, draping reindeer hides over
   logs for us to sit on, and hung a kettle to boil. The simplicity of the
   arrangement appealed to my sense of how these things ought to be
   conducted, and even though there was thick cloud cover, I felt
   optimistic. We had two and a half hours to kill, and the weather, as we
   reminded one another at regular intervals, was unpredictable in these
   parts.

   Most of the people in our group were Chinese, on vacation for the
   Chinese New Year. But I also heard Italian voices, and the genteel
   tones of Home Counties English. Those came from a British couple,
   recent retirees from Surrey who were checking things off their bucket
   list. A safari in Zambia would follow the northern lights. They’d been
   in Inari for four nights, and had seen a faint glow one evening, after
   being roused by the hotel’s Aurora Alert. It hadn’t impressed them.
   “Definitely not worth being woken up for,” they said. They talked about
   the disparity between photographs of the aurora borealis and what you
   can actually see, making some technical point that I didn’t take in at
   the time, and grumbled, “They ought to tell you about this.” I asked
   them if they regretted coming. Not at all, they said. They had enjoyed
   the activities and appreciated the differentness of the place: the
   Finnish tundra is another world from Surrey. “It’s like in Africa,
   where you know you might not see anything but you just enjoy the whole
   experience,” they said.

   Our guide, young but practiced in the art of distracting cold tourists,
   poured hot berry juice and discoursed on Arctic matters. He told us the
   average number of hairs on a square centimetre of a reindeer’s
   back—seventeen hundred—and explained the logic behind the Kp index, a
   tool for predicting auroras. The index, in use since 1939, measures
   disturbances in the Earth’s magnetic field, with stronger disturbances
   indicating higher chances of seeing an aurora.

   A smudge of light appeared to the west, and we looked at our guide
   hopefully, but he shook his head: it was just snowmobile headlights
   reflected by clouds. Someone asked him what it felt like to see a truly
   powerful display, and he replied that it was “a spiritual experience.”
   I pressed him on this. “Well, it’s about community,” he said. “One
   person’s wonder communicates itself to the rest of the group, and you
   get this flow of emotion.” It seemed like a good answer. It certainly
   accounted for a vague feeling I’d had in my glass igloo, which was that
   even if I did see the lights there’d be something sad and incomplete
   about not having anyone with me to share the experience. I’d been with
   an old friend when I helicoptered into the Grand Canyon. My son was
   with me for the orcas in Puget Sound.

   The sky showed no sign of clearing, and the Kp-index reading had
   plummeted. Meanwhile, the temperature had fallen to minus ten degrees
   Fahrenheit, which turned every gust of wind into a scouring assault.
   People were pulling up balaclavas and stamping their feet. No surprises
   occurred overhead, but an earthly one did: a woman suddenly slipped her
   arm through mine and began murmuring in my ear in Italian. I looked at
   her, and she gave a shriek: she’d mistaken me, in my snowsuit, for her
   husband. Peals of unnerving laughter broke from her as we sledded back
   across the lake. The incident gave concreteness to the dim sense of
   cosmic disfavor beginning to take hold in me. The nature of these
   wonder-chasing trips is that your success rate sooner or later gets
   entangled with your feelings about what you deserve. I had four more
   nights, so there was no cause for serious alarm, but I’d started
   entertaining irrational thoughts all the same. Was I unworthy in some
   way? Could I be harboring attitudes unconducive to the granting of
   heavenly visions?

   A couple of incidents the next day deepened this mood. I was on my way
   to Tromsø, in Norway. To get there without making an extended southern
   detour to Oslo, I had to take a three-hour taxi ride from Inari to the
   Norwegian village of Lakselv, which has an airport. As we drove
   northwest, the landscape and the sky merged into a white haze, with
   only the dark-etched undersides of branches to distinguish one realm
   from the other. It was beautiful in an unearthly way, as if the world
   had become a silver-nitrate photograph of itself. Road signs grew fewer
   and farther between, with Sámi place-names appearing under the Finnish.
   The road was covered with packed snow and the driver was going fast. On
   a long, straight, desolate stretch, we came over a rise and saw five
   reindeer galloping straight toward us. The driver cursed in English:
   “Shit.” I braced myself, felt a slam, and saw one of the animals thrown
   into the air. It had antlers, and, as the previous night’s guide had
   informed us, a deer that still had them in late winter was female, and
   probably pregnant. We backed up and found it lying, dead, in the snow.
   The taxi was dented but drivable, and after reporting the accident we
   continued on our way, both of us badly shaken.

   The northern lights can occur at any hour. For the tourist, the
   question arises: what do you do when there’s no prospect of seeing the
   lights, which is much of the time?Photograph by Joakim Eskildsen /
   Institute for The New Yorker

   We arrived at the airport at 11 a.m. I got out of the taxi and
   approached the automatic door, but it didn’t open. I turned to call
   back my driver, but he’d sped off into the frozen wilderness. I shouted
   and banged on the airport windows, but nobody was inside. A stuffed
   reindeer, harnessed to a sleigh, stared at me through the plate glass
   of the empty departure lounge. Under the circumstances, it was
   impossible not to read judgment in its blank expression.

   Nordic folklore tends to view the northern lights as a not entirely
   benign phenomenon. Sámi mythology, in particular, invests them with
   highly equivocal powers. They can predict the weather, but they can
   also whisk people away. You can attract them by whistling, but you do
   so at your peril. As I stood on the airport curb, wondering what to do,
   it struck me that the aurora industry was a kind of elaborate whistling
   for the lights, with all the folly and hubris that this entailed. It
   sold itself as a romance with nature at its most magical, but it was
   premised on a comprehensive battle against nature. Its imagery of cozy
   warmth and gliding ease had been concocted in defiance of a lethally
   dangerous environment where you were entirely dependent on protections
   devised by other humans. It seemed to me that I was now being shown
   what happened when those systems malfunctioned. I felt scared and
   stupid. I was a fool about to freeze to death in pursuit of a high-end
   tourist fad.

   Eventually, I flagged down a passing car, whose driver promised to make
   a call on my behalf, and after a long twenty minutes an airport worker
   appeared and opened the doors. He laughed at my story, telling me that
   I’d arrived far too early for my afternoon flight. Two hours later,
   just before takeoff, other passengers began strolling in—blasé locals
   in T-shirts and sneakers.

   Tromsø is a compact, gleaming city set dramatically on two sides of a
   sound, with an old quarter of timber buildings, a thriving fishing
   industry, and the world’s northernmost university. I ate quantities of
   smoked and pickled fish, and visited the Polar Museum, with its baleful
   dioramas of trapped foxes and hunters clubbing baby seals. I took a
   dogsled safari, and guided Siberian huskies on a wobbly but
   exhilarating ten-mile dash, by moonlight, across stunning upland fells.
   In every one of Tromsø’s hotel lobbies, screens glowed with images of
   the lights.

   I’d been advised to try looking for them from the water, and went out
   in a catamaran. The city sparkled on either side of the boat as the
   skipper and I cruised down the sound, but the sky was solid cloud, and
   we soon gave up craning our necks and chatted about the aurora craze
   instead. Everyone seems to have a different origin story. The skipper
   attributed the boom to a [24]2008 BBC show on the lights, featuring
   Joanna Lumley. As he put it, “There was before Joanna Lumley, and there
   was after.”

   Six million people had watched the “Absolutely Fabulous” star diffuse
   English poshness into the Arctic mists as she travelled northward
   through Norway. The sites she visited were soon struggling with sudden
   popularity. (Google the Lofoten Islands, an archipelago south of
   Tromsø, and you’ll learn more than you wanted to know about their
   insufficient number of public toilets.) Lumley was as unlucky as I was
   until she came to Tromsø, where her guide and photographer, Kjetil
   Skogli, finally delivered the goods. In the show’s orgasmic climax, the
   actress lies on her back in the snow as the sky explodes in jets of
   green.

   I met with Skogli in Tromsø. He is a slight, unassuming man in his
   fifties, with an impish way of deflecting questions about his
   post-Lumley celebrity clients (Brian May, of Queen, is among them).
   Skogli grew up in a small village where elders spoke the Sámi language
   and children hid from the lights, fearing cosmic abduction. An evening
   outing with a photographer friend in the fall of 2003 coincided with a
   series of unusually intense solar storms, and the spectacle awakened
   Skogli to the lights’ glory. “Mostly, you just see green,” he told me.
   “But you saw all the other colors that night. The snow was colored
   red.” He was also awakened to the lights’ commercial potential. “The
   northern lights wasn’t a product at that time,” he recalled. “But
   they’re one of the purest wonders of the world.” Moreover, the lights
   have the advantage of not being affected by global warming. As Skogli
   put it, “We can’t do anything to spoil them!”

   village of Kilpisjärvi, in western Finland.Photograph by Joakim

   He set up a photography-tour company that pioneered the idea of the
   Aurora Chase: you’re driven around for six or more hours in pursuit of
   favorable conditions for viewing the lights. Every fjord and fell has
   its own microclimate, and so in theory there’s always a chance of
   finding clear skies somewhere. After the Lumley film aired, Skogli
   created a four-day Lumley Route and, as other Scandinavians got into
   the aurora-chasing business, he began working with local landowners to
   set up “base stations” for the tourist traffic that had spread across
   the region. “It’s not good to see fifty or sixty coaches parked on the
   side of a road,” he said. “There’ve been some very close accidents.”

   We discussed why the aurora often looks so much better in photographs.
   He explained that a camera on a tripod, set for a five-second exposure,
   takes in far more light than the human eye does when it looks at
   something, and consequently it produces a more vivid image. A camera
   can turn even relatively weak displays into dramatic pictures—and these
   images can then be subjected to digital enhancements. Posted online,
   the pictures are automatically sharpened by the high-contrast settings
   of most social-media platforms, and further boosted by the backlit
   screens of our devices. Cumulatively, these improvements have
   encouraged unrealistic expectations. “It’s a shame,” Skogli said. “You
   have a responsibility to show the truth.” He has tried to open a
   discussion on the subject within the tourism industry, without success.
   In a rare departure from diplomatic geniality, he dismissed most
   Instagram photos of the lights as junk—“digitally colorized files to
   produce likes.”

   Thinking that I might win over the aurora gods by trying something more
   primitive than my other accommodations, I’d signed up for a night with
   a Finnish company that takes you out to a “wilderness camp” and leaves
   you alone until morning. That night had come around, and I was slightly
   regretting my plan. I had no idea what to expect, but various scenarios
   had begun filling the void, mostly turning on the idea of abandonment
   and slow death. It didn’t help that the tour-company driver had a
   penchant for morbid tales. There was the story of his grandfather, who
   had died of a heart attack while herding reindeer and had been left in
   a tarp on the roadside, where his son recognized the boots sticking
   out. There was the whale that starved in a fjord, whose corpse had to
   be towed out to sea and exploded. Then, there were the two snowmobilers
   who’d recently disappeared after going off-piste. “They say the cold
   gives you a gentle death,” the driver observed.

   We crossed the border and entered the village of Kilpisjärvi, in
   western Finland. I climbed into a sled, and my amiable and capable
   guide, Jussi Rauhala, used a snowmobile to tow me to the camp, two and
   a half miles across the frozen surface of Lake Kilpisjärvi. At the
   midpoint of the journey, he stopped and got off the snowmobile, to see
   how I was doing. “The ice is fifteen per cent thinner than usual this
   year,” he remarked, in halting but studious English. “But for a
   snowmobile it should be fine.”

   We rounded a promontory with scrubby birches doubled over by snow, and
   came to a dark hut, raised up on sled runners, on the ice. An outhouse
   stood off to the side. It was cozy inside the hut, with a
   banged-together quality that I liked, though spending the night there
   still seemed disconcerting. Jussi turned on a propane heater, which
   blasted ferocious heat at wooden furnishings a few feet away. He
   attached several spare cannisters of fuel to the heater. “Just in case
   they run out,” he explained. “But they won’t.” The door had been fitted
   extra tight, to prevent it from being blown open by the wind, and you
   had to give it a mighty kick to get out. The possibility of being
   unable to tug the door back open was enough to rule out any thought of
   a solitary nocturnal visit to the outhouse. Jussi, possibly noting my
   anxiousness, pointed to a transparent section of roof above the bed,
   and told me that it was made of riot-shield plastic. I tried to look
   reassured.

   We walked about thirty feet to the shore of the lake, and set up a
   fire. Jussi assembled a camera tripod. The Kp numbers were promising,
   and a pool of clear sky had opened among the clouds, with the Big
   Dipper brightly visible. Jussi programmed his camera to take a
   long-exposure photograph every few minutes; after a while, he checked
   the monitor and saw a faint green glow. At first, I couldn’t see
   anything in the sky, but after a minute what had looked like an oblique
   bar of cloud began turning a dim grayish green. It was tremendously
   exciting. The camera then began registering bands of red—although they
   weren’t visible to the naked eye, they signalled that there was a
   strong solar wind. The bar in the sky grew brighter, but a terrestrial
   wind had also risen, driving thick clouds straight toward it. A tense
   couple of minutes followed, in which we seemed to be watching an
   elemental standoff between darkness and light. For a few moments, the
   green bar was surrounded by tinges of violet: the effect of atmospheric
   nitrogen complementing that of the green-glowing oxygen. But the clouds
   kept moving implacably forward, and, crushingly, the bar began to fade.

   I could now say truthfully that I’d seen the northern lights, and I was
   happy, though my happiness had more to do with relief—mission
   accomplished—than with joy. It had been a very minor spillage of the
   green grail. The camera kept seeing it for a while, and Jussi was able
   to take some photographs of me posed against it with a thumbs-up and a
   grin—a triumphant bucket-list warrior. It’s hard to gauge the
   documentary status of such images. Do they memorialize my evening, or
   the camera’s? The question goes to the heart of what I was beginning to
   think of as the second conundrum of northern-lights tourism: its
   seemingly inextricable incorporation of digital technology into human
   sensory experience.

   It was time for Jussi to leave. He gave me a basket of food and a Nokia
   phone for emergencies. He told me that his cousin would pick me up at
   eight in the morning, “if he wakes up.” He paused, then added, “He has
   never not woken up. But, just in case he does not wake up, you can call
   me.” I laughed, hoping that this was just Finnish humor, and watched
   him disappear into the darkness. Snow was falling. I battened down the
   hatches and got into bed. On the other side of the riot-shield roof,
   the clouds grew thicker.

   I wondered if I’d have it in me to rise to the occasion if I did see a
   major display. When an industry is focussed so determinedly on the
   commodity of wonderment, it spurs thoughts of resistance—at least, it
   does in me. Moreover, my knowledge that the lights were merely an
   effect of physical forces—and not, say, the souls of stillborn babies,
   or reflections of the armor of the Valkyries—would surely limit my
   capacity to be awestruck.

   I slept fitfully, trying to ignore the sounds of cracking ice that I
   kept hearing, and was possibly imagining. In the morning,
   congratulating myself on not having used the emergency phone, I
   breakfasted on cloudberry doughnuts and homemade dried reindeer. At
   eight o’clock sharp, Jussi’s cousin picked me up.

   For my final evening in Tromsø, I’d booked a seat on an Aurora Chase.
   At the appointed hour, I joined the crowds heading down to the
   waterfront, where the chase vehicles picked up passengers. I heard a
   coach driver mutter, “Not the best weather outlook tonight.” The
   prospect of spending the next six hours driving around with little hope
   of seeing the lights was deeply unenticing. I was about to bail on the
   adventure when a burly Norseman barked out my name from his roster. I
   meekly boarded his sleek black van.

   We headed southeast, toward Finland. The Norseman, whose name was
   Halfdan, kept up a jovial patter as we sped past frozen fjordscapes.
   I’d already learned most of what he talked about: aurora factoids,
   camera-settings advice, Kp numbers. The sense of déjà vu became
   terrifyingly complete when I heard the driver mutter “Shit” and saw a
   moose planted, like a thatched cottage, on the road ahead of us. At the
   last moment, it decamped over the guardrail, and our lunatic chase
   continued.

   An hour into Finland, we pulled off the main road and parked. Using his
   phone, Halfdan had gathered data indicating that the spot was
   auspicious. I disembarked, with fifteen companions, into the freezing
   night. Tripods were set up, a fire was built. I chatted with the
   driver, who told me that there were now a hundred and forty chase
   companies operating out of Tromsø, many of them without proper permits
   or insurance. Every hotel was at capacity. He mentioned that he had a
   day job, manufacturing fishing equipment, and I wondered how this might
   affect his night-driving skills.

   A second bus, twice the size of ours, pulled into the parking area. I
   had become highly suspicious of all the apps and meteorological charts
   that were being consulted, but this time my skepticism was misplaced. A
   crack appeared in the clouds directly above us. It widened, showing a
   sprinkling of stars and then the entire Big Dipper. There was a
   stirring among the photographers: their cameras had started detecting
   things. After a moment, an oblique greenish bar like the one I’d seen
   the night before became visible. It grew brighter and denser, then
   contracted into an oval of emerald light. People chattered excitedly. I
   was about to warn them not to get too carried away when a streak of
   brilliant green shot out of the oval, at high speed, and zoomed over
   our tipped-back heads, corkscrewing across the sky. I almost toppled
   over while following its trajectory. The green light formed several
   tentacles, which twisted and writhed together and looped in circles.
   Astonishment was proclaimed in a half-dozen languages. The circles
   dropped needles of piercing brightness that travelled, in tandem,
   around the sky, as if tracing the undulations of a celestial shower
   curtain.

   There is something at once mind-blowing and unassimilable about the
   phenomenon. The aurora borealis is, in [25]Karl Ove Knausgaard’s
   phrase, “immensely foreign,” and it puts you into a kind of panic in
   which you want to simultaneously observe it, describe it, rejoice in
   it, interpret it, and record it. Nothing you’ve learned or read about
   the subject—scientific, folkloric, touristic—seems remotely adequate or
   even relevant to the experience. You develop the overwhelming
   impression that some cryptic but staggeringly powerful intelligence is
   staging a performance expressly for you, even as you remind yourself
   that this can’t be the case. Surprisingly intense emotions grip you. I
   remembered something that Kjetil Skogli told me about one of his
   expeditions: an English guy, overcome by the display, dropped to his
   knees and proposed to his girlfriend.

   Back in the bus, the photographers among the group compared images. I’d
   attempted to take some snapshots on my phone, but they were terrible. I
   was relieved to discover that Halfdan had taken nice pictures of each
   of us, including one of me with the stunned look of a nonbeliever
   witnessing a miracle. He promised that he would post them online in a
   day or two. We would then scatter these glowing pixels around the
   world, bringing our part in this drama of pain and pleasure, of eye and
   camera, of reality and illusion, to its inevitable close. ♦
