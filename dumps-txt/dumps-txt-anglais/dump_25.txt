   You may have seen the sparkle of fireflies on a summer’s night. The
   fireflies produce light through a chemical reaction in their glowing
   abdomens, a process known as bioluminescence. But did you know that
   seascapes can also glow and glitter thanks to the light producing
   abilities of [71]many marine organisms? Some fish dangle a lighted lure
   in front of their mouths to attract prey, while some squid shoot out
   bioluminescent liquid, instead of ink, to confuse their predators.
   Worms and tiny crustaceans also use bioluminescence to attract mates.

   Humans primarily see bioluminescence triggered by a physical
   disturbance, such as waves or a moving boat hull, that gets the animal
   to show their light off, but often animals light up in response to an
   attack or in order to attract a mate. Bioluminescent organisms live
   throughout the water column, from the surface to the seafloor, from
   near the coast to the open ocean. In the deep sea, bioluminescence is
   extremely common, and because the deep sea is so vast, bioluminescence
   may be the most common form of communication on the planet!

Underwater Light

How it’s made

   A photo of a lanternfish with its nasal light organ illuminated.
   This [72]lanternfish (Diaphus sp.), found in the Red Sea, has
   light-producing photophores along its ventral surface (belly), and a
   nasal light organ that acts like a headlight. (E. Widder, ORCA,
   [73]www.teamorca.org)

   Bioluminescence occurs through a [74]chemical reaction that produces
   light energy within an organism's body. For a reaction to occur, a
   species must contain luciferin, a molecule that, when it reacts with
   oxygen, produces light. There are different types of luciferin, which
   vary depending on the animal hosting the reaction. Many organisms also
   produce the catalyst luciferase, which helps to speed up the reaction.

   Animals can closely control when they light up by regulating their
   chemistry and brain processes depending on their immediate needs,
   whether a meal or a mate. Some organisms even bundle the luciferin with
   oxygen in what is called a “photoprotein”—like a pre-packaged
   bioluminescence bomb—that is ready to light up the moment a certain ion
   (typically calcium) becomes present. They can even choose the intensity
   and color of the lights.

Who makes it?

   Sunset? Time to glow! A biological clock triggers bioluminescence in
   the dinoflagellate [75]Pyrocystis fusiformis. At dusk, cells produce
   the chemicals responsible for its light. (E. Widder, ORCA,
   [76]www.teamorca.org)

   Bioluminescence is found in many marine organisms: bacteria, algae,
   jellyfish, worms, crustaceans, sea stars, fish, and sharks to name just
   a few. In fish alone, there are about 1,500 known species that
   luminesce. In some cases, animals take in bacteria or other
   bioluminescent creatures to gain the ability to light up. For example,
   the [77]Hawaiian bobtail squid has a special light organ that is
   colonized by bioluminescent bacteria within hours of its birth. But
   usually, the animal itself contains the chemicals necessary for the
   reaction that produces bioluminescence. The number of species that
   bioluminesce and the variations in the chemical reactions that produce
   light are evidence that bioluminescence has evolved many times over—at
   least 40 separate times! This number continues to grow as research
   makes new discoveries. In 2018, scientists discovered the
   ray-finned fishes themselves evolved bioluminescence [78]27
   separate times. That's quite an increase from the handful of times that
   were known before.

   Most deep-sea animals produce some bioluminescent light, but the
   phenomenon isn’t relegated to the deep: one of the most common
   sightings occurs at the surface of the ocean. Many small planktonic
   surface dwellers—such as single-celled dinoflagellates—are
   bioluminescent. When conditions are right, dinoflagellates bloom in
   dense layers at the surface of the water, causing the ocean to take on
   a reddish-brown color in daylight and a [79]sparkly sheen as they move
   in the waves at night. When the dinoflagellates are poisonous to other
   animals, these events are called [80]harmful algal blooms (HABs). When
   they're eaten, the toxic dinoflagellates accumulate in high
   concentrations in larger fish and filter feeding shellfish. And then
   when marine mammals or people eat these organisms, it can cause
   sickness or even death.

What Color is Bioluminescence?

   Light travels in waves of different shapes—known as wavelengths—which
   determine the color of the light. When the waves hit our eyes, they are
   [82]translated into colors by the brain depending on their wavelength.
   The wavelengths that our eyes can see are known as the "visible light
   spectrum," and we can see all the colors on this spectrum as they
   travel through the air above land. But light travels differently
   underwater because longer wavelengths can't travel as far. Most of the
   bioluminescence produced in the ocean is in the form of blue-green
   light. This is because these colors are shorter wavelengths of light,
   which can travel through (and thus be seen) in both shallow and deep
   water. Light traveling from the sun of longer wavelengths—such as red
   light—doesn't reach the deep sea. This is why many deep sea animals are
   red: it's effectively the same as being invisible. Moreover, because
   it's not present, many deep-water animals have lost the ability to see
   it altogether. However, [83]some animals evolved to emit and see red
   light, including the dragonfish (Malacosteus). By creating their own
   red light in the deep sea, they are able to see red-colored prey, as
   well as communicate and even show prey to other dragonfish, while other
   unsuspecting animals cannot see their red lights as a warning to flee.

Why Animals Light Up

Feeding

   yellow bioluminescent ring around her mouth.

   mates. (Michael Vecchione/NOAA)

   Animals can use their light to lure prey towards their mouths, or even
   to light up the area nearby so that they can see their next meal a bit
   better. Sometimes the prey being lured can be small plankton, like
   those attracted to the bioluminescence around the beak of the
   [84]Stauroteuthis octopus. But the light can also fool larger animals.
   Whales and squid are attracted to the glowing underside of the
   cookie-cutter shark, which [85]grabs a bite out of the animals once
   they are close. The deep-sea anglerfish lures prey straight to its
   mouth with a dangling bioluminescent barbel, lit by glowing bacteria.

Attracting Mates

   Syllid fireworms can be found mainly on the seafloor, but they switch
   to a planktonic form to reproduce, where the females use bioluminescent
   signals.

   signals. (© 2010 Moorea Biocode)

   Animals don't only need to look for and attract food; bioluminescence
   can also play a part in attracting a mate. The male Caribbean ostracod,
   a tiny crustacean, [86]uses bioluminescent signals on its upper lips to
   attract females. Syllid fireworms live on the seafloor, but with the
   onset of the full moon they move to the open water where the females of
   some species, like Odontosyllis enopla, use bioluminescence to attract
   males while moving around in circles. These glowing worms may have even
   [87]helped to welcome Christopher Columbus to the New World.
   Anglerfish, flashlight fish and ponyfish all are thought to luminesce
   in order to tell the difference between males and females, or otherwise
   communicate in order to mate.

Protection

   Often animals use a strong flash of bioluminescence to scare off an
   impending predator. The bright signal can [88]startle and distract the
   predator and cause confusion about the whereabouts of its target. From
   small copepods to the larger vampire squid, this tactic can be very
   useful in the deep-sea. The "green bomber" worm ([89]Swima
   bombiviridis) and four other similar worm species from the polychaete
   family [90]release a bioluminescent "bomb" from their body when in
   harms way. These deep sea worms live close to the sea bottom and were
   only discovered in 2009. Some animals such as the deep-sea squid
   Octopoteuthis deletron even [91]detach their bioluminescent arms, which
   stick to and probably distract their predators. All this commotion
   could also serve as a burglar alarm, attracting larger predators to the
   scene. In certain cases a predator might only get a bite of their prey,
   and the evidence will keep glowing from within its stomach.

   Bioluminescence can also be used to help camouflage with the use of
   [92]counterillumination. Photophores on the bottom side of an animal
   can match the dim light coming from the surface, making it harder for
   predators searching for prey from below to see what they are looking
   for.

Human Connections

Art

   For the animals who bioluminesce, it is a matter of communicating and
   protecting themselves from being eaten or hurt. But for humans, the
   beautiful colors and light that are produced by bioluminescence can be
   works of art.

   A temporary exhibit at the National Museum of Natural History in 2012
   explored these links between art and science. Artist Shih Chieh Huang
   [93]created hanging installations in the dark space of the museum that
   lit up and looked as if they were floating in the deep-sea. Some
   artists use the bacteria itself to create [94]living drawings or entire
   [95]exhibits with petri dishes full of the glowing single-celled
   organisms.

   You can also [96]make your own bioluminescent art!

Science

   The elusive giant squid

   species in its natural habitat. (NHK/NEP/Discovery Channel )

   Bioluminescence can also be used as a tool by researchers to learn more
   about the ocean and its mysteries. Edie Widder, a scientist who
   specializes in bioluminescence, was with a group [97]attempting to film
   the giant squid for the first time. She suspected that the giant squid
   would be lured to a bioluminescent light attached to a fake squid—not
   because it wanted to eat the small fake squid, but because its flashing
   light "burglar alarm" could mean that there was larger prey in the
   vicinity. Her theory proved right. A [98]live giant squid was captured
   for the first time on film in 2012!
