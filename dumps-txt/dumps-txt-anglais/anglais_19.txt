   Refraction is the bending of the path of a light wave as it passes
   across the boundary separating two media. Refraction is caused by the
   change in speed experienced by a wave when it changes medium. Lesson 1,
   focused on the topics of "What causes refraction?" and "Which direction
   does light refract?" In that lesson, we learned that light can either
   refract towards the normal (when slowing down while crossing the
   boundary) or away from the normal (when speeding up while crossing the
   boundary). The focus of Lesson 2 is upon the question of "By how much
   does light refract when it crosses a boundary?" In the first part of
   Lesson 2, we learned that a comparison of the angle of refraction to
   the angle of incidence provides a good measure of the refractive
   ability of any given boundary. The more that light refracts, the bigger
   the difference between these two angles. In this part of Lesson 2, we
   will learn about a mathematical equation relating these two angles and
   the indices of refraction of the two materials on each side of the
   boundary.

[u14l2b1.gif] A Lesson from the Laboratory

   To begin, consider a hemi-cylindrical dish filled with water. Suppose
   that a laser beam is directed towards the flat side of the dish at the
   exact center of the dish. The angle of incidence can be measured at the
   point of incidence. This ray will refract, bending towards the normal
   (since the light is passing from a medium in which it travels fast into
   one in which it travels slow - FST). Once the light ray enters the
   water, it travels in a straight line until it reaches the second
   boundary. At the second boundary, the light ray is approaching along
   the normal to the curved surface (this stems from the geometry of
   circles). The ray does not refract upon exiting since the angle of
   incidence is 0-degrees (recall the If I Were An Archer Fish page). The
   ray of laser light therefore exits at the same angle as the refracted
   ray of light made at the first boundary. These two angles can be
   measured and recorded. The angle of incidence of the laser beam can be
   changed to 5-degrees and new measurements can be made and recorded.
   This process can be repeated until a complete data set of accurate
   values has been collected. The data below show a representative set of
   data for such an experiment.

                        Angle of Incidence (degrees)
                        Angle of Refraction (degrees)

   An inspection of the data above reveals that there is no clear linear
   relationship between the angle of incidence and the angle of
   refraction. For example, a doubling of the angle of incidence from 40
   degrees to 80 degrees does not result in a doubling of the angle of
   refraction. Thus, a plot of this data would not yield a straight line.
   If however, the sine of the angle of incidence and the sine of the
   angle of refraction were plotted, the plot would be a straight line,
   indicating a linear relationship between the sines of the important
   angles. If two quantities form a straight line on a graph, then a
   mathematical relationship can be written in y = m*x + b form. A plot of
   the sine of the angle of incidence vs. the sine of the angle of
   refraction is shown below.

                                [u14l2b2.gif]


   The equation relating the angles of incidence (Θ[i]) and the angle of
   refraction (Θ[r]) for light passing from air into water is given as

                                [u14l2b3.gif]

   Observe that the constant of proportionality in this equation is 1.33 -
   the index of refraction value of water. Perhaps it's just a
   coincidence. But if the semi-cylindrical dish full of water was
   replaced by a semi-cylindrical disk of Plexiglas, the constant of
   proportionality would be 1.51 - the index of refraction value of
   Plexiglas. This is not just a coincidence. The same pattern would
   result for light traveling from air into any material. Experimentally,
   it is found that for a ray of light traveling from air into some
   material, the following equation can be written.

                                [u14l2b4.gif]

           where n[material] = index of refraction of the material

   This study of the refraction of light as it crosses from one material
   into a second material yields a general relationship between the sines
   of the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction. This general
   relationship is expressed by the following equation:

                                [u14l2b5.gif]

                where Θ[i] ("theta i") = angle of incidence

                    Θr ("theta r") = angle of refraction

              n[i] = index of refraction of the incident medium

             n[r] = index of refraction of the refractive medium

   This relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction and
   the indices of refraction of the two media is known as Snell's Law.
   Snell's law applies to the refraction of light in any situation,
   regardless of what the two media are.


Using Snell's Law to Predict An Angle Value

   As with any equation in physics, the Snell's Law equation is valued for
   its predictive ability. If any three of the four variables in the
   equation are known, the fourth variable can be predicted if appropriate
   problem-solving skills are employed. This is illustrated in the two
   examples below.

                              Example Problems

   In the following two examples, use Snell's law, the sine button on your
       calculator, a protractor, and the index of refraction values to
      complete the following diagrams. Measure [thetaI.gif] , calculate
   [thetaR.gif] , and draw in the refracted ray with the calculated angle
                               of refraction.

                                [u14l2b6.gif]


   In each of these two example problems, the angle of refraction is the
   variable to be determined. The indices of refraction (n[i] and n[r])
   are given and the angle of incidence can be measured. With three of the
   four variables known, substitution into Snell's law followed by
   algebraic manipulation will lead to the answer.




                            Solution to Example A

   First, use a protractor to measure the angle of incidence. An
   appropriate measurement would be some angle close to 45-degrees.

   Second, list all known values and the unknown value for which you wish
   to solve:

   Given:

     n[i] = 1.00 [spacer.gif] n[r] = 1.33 [spacer.gif] Θ[i] = 45 degrees

   Find:

     Θr = ???

   Third, list the relevant equation:

                                [u14l2b5.gif]

   Fourth, substitute known values into the equation and algebraically
   manipulate the equation in order to solve for the unknown variable
   - Θr.

                1.00 * sine (45 degrees) = 1.33 * sine (Θr)

                         0.7071 = 1.33 * sine (Θr)

                             0.532 = sine (Θr)

                    sine^-1 (0.532) = sine^-1 ( sine Θr)

                             32.1 degrees = Θr


   Proper algebra yields to the answer of 32.1 degrees for the angle of
   refraction. The diagram showing the refracted ray can be viewed by

                              Quick Quiz Answer

   Answer: 34.7 degrees

   Measure the angle of incidence - the angle between the normal and
   incident ray. It is approximately 60 degrees.

   List known Values:

     n[i ]=1.00

     n[r ]=1.52

     Theta i = 60 degrees

   List Unknown: Find theta r

   Substitute into Snell's law equation and perform the necessary
   algebraic operations to solve:

     1.00 • sine(60 degrees) = 1.52 • sine(theta r)

     0.8660 = 1.52 • sine(theta r)

     0.570 = sine(theta r)

     34.7 degrees = theta r

   Now draw the refracted ray at an angle of 34.7 degrees from the normal
   - see diagram below.

                               [u14l2b7b.gif]



   Snell's Law provides the quantitative means of answering the question
   of "By how much does the light ray refract?" The task of answering this
   question involves using indices of refraction and the angle of
   incidence values in order to determine the angle of refraction. This
   problem-solving process is discussed in more detail on the remaining
   pages of Lesson 2.

   Laser light is shown passing into and out of a hemi-cylindrical dish
   filled with water. The light enters the water (at the curved side of
   the dish) along the normal line; no bending occurs upon entry. The
   light continues through the water along a straight line until it
   reaches the boundary with air (at the flat side of the dish). The angle
   of incidence in the water is approximately 39°. At this angle, the
   light refracts out of the water into the surrounding air bending away
   from the normal. The angle of refraction in the air is approximately
   57°. These values for the angle of incidence and refraction are
   consistent with Snell's Law.
