Gaslighting

   Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff

   Gaslighting is an insidious form of manipulation and psychological
   control. Victims of gaslighting are deliberately and systematically fed
   false information that leads them to question what they know to be
   true, often about themselves. They may end up doubting their memory,
   their perception, and even their sanity. Over time, a gaslighter’s
   manipulations can grow more complex and potent, making it increasingly
   difficult for the victim to see the truth.

How Gaslighting Works

   fizkes/Shutterstock

   The term gaslighting comes from a 1938 play, Gas Light, and its film
   adaptation. Gaslighting can occur in personal or professional
   relationships, and victims are targeted at the core of their being:
   their sense of identity and self-worth. Manipulative people who engage
   in gaslighting do so to attain power over their victims, either because
   they simply derive warped enjoyment from the act or because they wish
   to emotionally, physically or financially control their victim.
   How does gaslighting begin?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   A relationship with a gaslighter may seem to start out quite well. They
   may praise their target on a first date and immediately confide in
   them. Such disclosure, before any intimacy has been established,
   establishes trust quickly; it’s part of a tactic known as love bombing.
   The more quickly a victim becomes enamored, the more quickly the next
   phase of manipulation can begin.
   What are a gaslighter’s tactics?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   A gaslighter will initially lie about simple things, but the volume of
   misinformation soon grows, and the gaslighter may accuse the victim of
   lying if he or she questions the narrative. They typically deploy
   occasional positive reinforcement to confuse the victim and keep them
   off balance, but at the same time, they may attempt to turn others
   against the victim, even their own friends and family, by telling them
   that the victim has been lying or is delusional.
   How do you know that you're being gaslighted?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   Self-doubt may rise as the gaslighter insists that what the victim
   remembers, thinks, and feels is wrong. The manipulative individual may
   then introduce lies in more sensitive arenas, aiming to disrupt and
   distort foundational aspects of the victim’s being, wearing them down,
   establishing confusion, and forcing them to rely on the gaslighter’s
   version of reality.
   Is gaslighting ever unintentional?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   It is possible for an individual to manipulate someone without
   realizing they are doing so. Importantly, though, the person still
   enjoys wielding control over the mind and behavior of the victim, even
   if they cannot articulate or acknowledge it. Some people engage in
   manipulative behavior because they witnessed it frequently as a child,
   most often in their parents. Regardless of a gaslighter's level of
   self-awareness, though, the behavior is never acceptable, and ignorance
   of its manipulative effects should not be accepted as an excuse.
   What is medical gaslighting?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   Medical gaslighting refers to a scenario in which a medical provider
   ignores or downplays an individual's legitimate medical concerns. This
   is a colloquial use of the term "gaslighting" and often refers to
   situations in which a medical provider may not actually intend to
   mislead or manipulate a patient; rather, they failed to take the
   patient's concerns seriously or to pursue them in an attempt to reach a
   diagnosis.

How to Recognize a Gaslighter

   Olena Yakobchuk/Shutterstock

   Gaslighting can be more effective and successful than many people
   imagine, and almost anyone can be susceptible to gaslighting tactics,
   which have been deployed throughout history, and continue to be used
   today, by domestic abusers, dictators, narcissists, and cult leaders.
   The most effective gaslighters are often the hardest to detect; they
   may be better recognized by their victims' actions and mental state.

   Those who employ this tactic often have a personality
   disorder—narcissistic personality disorder and psychopathy chief among
   them. Manipulators have a tendency to present one face to their target
   and another to the rest of the world, leading victims to assume that if
   they ask for help or speak out, no one will believe that they have been
   emotionally abused. Gaslighters typically repeat their tactics across
   several relationships.


   What’s the difference between gaslighting and manipulation?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   Manipulation is a key part of gaslighting, but manipulation is a fairly
   common tactic that almost anyone is capable of employing, while
   gaslighting, and gaslighters, are more rare. Children, for example, try
   to manipulate parents at an early age, and marketers aim to manipulate
   consumers, but gaslighting involves a pattern of abusive behaviors with
   the intent not just to influence someone, but actually to control them.
   What’s the difference between gaslighting and narcissism?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   A narcissist may be self-promoting and feel superior to others; a
   gaslighter aims to make another person question their own self-value.
   Gaslighting can sometimes be a tactic employed by someone with a
   narcissistic personality, but it is not a core trait of narcissistic
   personality disorder.

Leaving a Gaslighter

   wavebreakmedia/Shuterstock

   A primary goal of a gaslighter is to keep their victim hooked. If a
   victim disagrees with or questions the abuser, he or she may try to
   make it seem as if they themselves are being victimized by the target.
   Alternately, they may try to lure a reluctant partner back to them
   through positive reinforcement. Many people eventually find a way to
   escape a gaslighter’s influence, leaving the manipulator to search for
   a new victim; often, research suggests, they already have a target in
   mind.
   What is “hoovering”?
   (BUTTON)
   Created with Sketch.

   When someone tries to leave them, a gaslighter may turn to the tactic
   of  "hoovering," which takes its name from the vacuum-cleaner brand. A
   hoovering gaslighter will tell the victim how much they love him or
   her, and praise all of their positive qualities. They may also explain
   how things are going to change between them. But soon after the victim
   agrees to stay, things tend to go back to the way they were.
   How does gaslighting change a victim?

   Gaslighting can be psychologically devastating. It violates trust and
   upends an individual’s view that people are generally good, potentially
   making them suspicious of everyone close to them. Falling victim to a
   gaslighter also erodes a person’s trust in themselves and makes them
   forget what they once valued about themselves; after all, it’s easy to
   blame themselves for having been too trusting, vulnerable, or
   dependent. The experience makes some victims never want to be part of a
   relationship again.
