Beer Styles

   Learn more about the wonderful world of beer styles.
   Simply put, a beer style is a label given to a beer that describes its
   overall character and, oftentimes, its place of origin. It's a name
   that has been broadly accepted by brewers and consumers after years or
   even centuries of trial and error, scientific research, and marketing.
   The styles listed here reflect our own spin on the constantly evolving
   world of beer, with short, jargon-free descriptions included to help
   anyone understand the similarities and differences. Use these styles as
   a guide when reviewing a beer's appearance, aroma, taste, and feel.
