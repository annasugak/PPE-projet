   Innovation is at the core of architecture, expressed through new
   approaches to design, material experimentation, and, of course, ways of
   living. As a result, the conception of buildings and indoor spaces is
   constantly evolving. This evolution is especially evident in
   [132]regions with a rich cultural heritage, such as Spain, where
   innovation reinterprets traditional ways of relating to space. This
   attentiveness to memory and daily life [133]extends into interiors,
   where each intervention has the potential to actively reshape how
   people experience a space and open [134]new possibilities for living
   and interaction.

   Asking questions is the first step toward challenging what we take for
   granted and opening up new possibilities for planning and building.
   These questions, valuable in themselves, gain new strength when shared
   and examined through different perspectives. As they intersect with the
   experiences of professionals and brands, they weave together viewpoints
   that enrich the discussion. [144]Design fairs and events around the
   world have become spaces where these conversations gain momentum,
   fostering connections and encouraging collaborative dynamics. In this
   landscape, [145]Colombia has emerged as a hub, serving as a platform
   that promotes architecture and design [146]across Latin America and the
   Caribbean while bringing the region's voice to the global stage.

   For over five decades, Swiss photographer [156]Thomas Mayer has
   developed a serene, emotional, and documentary language for
   architecture. His lens captures the random and memorable moments of our
   built environment - reflections in the rain, long blue hours in Nordic
   summers, and the quiet darkness of sacred spaces. Recognized by
   ArchDaily as one of the [157]top architectural photographers, Mayer
   carries an abundant fascination for light and space.

[195]Healing Light: The Impact of "Liter of Light" on Community Well-Being

   Well-Being - Featured Image Cortesia de Litro de Luz

   Sometimes, the simplest solutions are the most revolutionary and
   impactful. During Brazil's energy crisis in 2002, mechanic [197]Alfredo
   Moser developed an accessible and effective way to illuminate indoor
   spaces during the day. Using only a PET bottle installed on the roof,
   filled with water and bleach, he harnessed the refraction of sunlight
   to bring brightness to spaces previously immersed in darkness. In
   self-built homes, where successive extensions often compromise natural
   light and ventilation, this solution makes a significant difference.
   Named the "[198]Moser lamp," the invention produces illumination
   equivalent to a 60W bulb and gained worldwide recognition through
   various reports. Since then, the project has continued to evolve and
   adapt to the needs of modern communities, transforming lives through a
   solution that is as simple as it is highly intelligent.

[201]Art, Activism, and the City: Illuminating Social Change

   The creative fusion of [203]art and activism in urban spaces has
   propelled the British collective Led by Donkeys into the spotlight,
   garnering millions of views for their interventions on [204]social
   media. Their critical visual occupations - whether billboard messages
   during the day or large-scale projections at night - raise a compelling
   question: which medium holds the greater persuasive power? The book
   "[205]Led by Donkeys: Adventures in Art, Activism and Accountability"
   offers a deep dive into their conceptual approach, charting their rapid
   evolution over six years. What began as a London-based response to
   Brexit has expanded into a global critique of political hypocrisy,
   addressing issues in [206]Europe, the Middle East, and America. For
   Peter Weibel, former director of the [207]ZKM Center for Art and Media
   in Karlsruhe, Germany, the innovative fusion of activism and art—or
   "Artivism"—represents the first new art form of the 21st century. Years
   of experience in environmental activism provided the group with crucial
   insights into the mechanics of political communication, the
   organization of public interventions, and the challenges of achieving
   meaningful societal change.

   Emotional Design - Featured Image Courtesy of Vibia

   When designing and lighting a space, is the goal to fulfill a specific
   requirement or to be creative? Both perspectives hold merit; however, a
   unifying principle should always prevail: people must remain at the
   center of everything we do. Today, it is well understood that our
   environment significantly [217]influences our well-being, affecting
   mood and performance, even in [218]challenging contexts such as outer
   space. While this standpoint has encompassed anthropometric and
   biological aspects, new approaches are expanding design beyond the
   tangible. [219]Lighting is now used to shape atmospheres that resonate
   deeply with our emotions.

[222]Light Above: A Bright Take on Architecture

   The [224]Pantheon in Rome is a true architectural masterpiece and holds
   the title of the largest unreinforced concrete dome in the world. Among
   its most remarkable elements is the central oculus — an 8.2-meter-wide
   opening at the top of the dome that allows natural light to enter. This
   creates a dynamic play of light and shadow that shifts throughout the
   day, enhancing the grandeur of the structure. Beyond its practical
   function, the oculus establishes a symbolic connection between the
   earthly and the divine, reflecting the Pantheon's original purpose as a
   temple dedicated to all gods. In fact, toplighting, which introduces
   natural light from above through skylights, domes, or other upper
   openings, contrasts with traditional windows, which capture light
   horizontally. By capturing direct sunlight, toplighting provides soft,
   diffuse illumination, creating more welcoming environments with better
   energy efficiency and a positive impact on mood and productivity.

   Corbusier's Color System - Featured Image LS 1912 toggle switches.

   [229]Barragán, Bofill, [230]Graves, and Le Corbusier are architects
   renowned for their exceptional and sensitive use of color. In their
   approaches, color takes on an importance comparable almost to
   functionality, achieved through a nuanced and comprehensive perception
   of their context. But [231]what is color? From a technical standpoint,
   it is a visual perception that arises from the interaction of light
   with our eyes and brain. However, when we explore its meaning on a more
   emotional and poetic level, it takes on a deeper significance. For
   [232]Ricardo Bofill, color infuses life into architecture, while for
   Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, —better known as [233]Le Corbusier—, it
   serves as a powerful tool to evoke emotions and create spatial
   illusions.

   In 'Polychromie Architecturale' Le Corbusier argues that color is not
   only a decorative element but also a fundamental tool for creating
   environments and enhancing the functionality of architectural spaces.
   This idea, developed between 1931 and 1959, is articulated around a
   system composed of a range of colors, where each tone has its relevance
   and contributes to creating atmospheres that transcend mere
   architectural design. An example is [234]JUNG's LS 1912 toggle switch
   range, which combines classic design with advanced control options and
   showcases the diverse hue variants of the 63 colors in [235]Le
   Corbusier's color system.

   [257]Robert Wilson embodies the roles of director, set designer,
   scenographer, lighting designer, and architect in a single figure.
   Internationally celebrated as a pioneer of stage lighting and honored
   with numerous prestigious awards, including the Golden Lion of the
   Venice Biennale and the Praemium Imperiale, Wilson, now in his
   eighties, continues to travel the world, staging remarkable
   productions. His use of light and color is marked by precision and
   [258]minimalism, creating scenes that skillfully oscillate between
   stillness and drama. During rehearsals at the Düsseldorf
   Schauspielhaus, he elaborates on the interplay between stage and
   architecture, his creative process, and the profound impact of light on
   darkness.

   Walls have long been more than mere structural elements; they are
   canvases that narrate stories, reflecting desires for nature,
   spirituality, or the pursuit of tranquility and stimulation. With
   advancements in addressable LED pixels, walls have evolved into
   immersive [269]digital surfaces capable of displaying any image in
   large format, adapting to the needs of the moment.

   However, while universities continue to train architects and interior
   designers to create static buildings, the art of meaningful
   storytelling through [270]digital screens—especially those with
   dynamics—remains largely unexplored in academic curricula.

   Climate Change after Dark - Featured Image Norwegian National Opera and
   Ballet, Oslo / Norway, 2008. Architecture: Snøhetta. Image © Thomas
   Mayer

   Over the years, the nocturnal landscape of cities has witnessed a
   significant transformation, marked by the emergence of more than
   80-night mayors globally, a trend that has been on the rise since the
   early 2000s. [275]Andreina Seijas, currently working as an Associate at
   [276]Gehl, has analyzed these [277]shifting dynamics of night-time
   governance in her research and during her doctoral studies at
   [278]Harvard GSD. Seijas speaks in the interview about this
   development, challenges, and opportunities with night mayors, global
   differences, and the role of climate change. Seijas' upbringing in
   Caracas, Venezuela, where safety concerns dictated strict curfews,
   ignited her passion for creating safer, more inclusive urban
   environments, particularly for the youth. Her quest for a better future
   for the urban night explores the potential for cities to become safer,
   more inclusive, and more productive by creating spaces for work and
   leisure after dark.

   Step into the realm where the minimalism of the 1960s [288]Light and
   Space movement intertwines with contemporary high-tech algorithms and
   sensors. Back then, light artists like James Turrell, Dan Flavin, and
   Robert Irwin captivated audiences with the bare essentials, using
   precisely daylight or lamps to heighten visual perception. Fast forward
   to today, [289]Chromasonic takes this synergy of light and color but
   augments it with sound and algorithms. Envisioned as a global network
   to experience the harmony of body and mind, [290]Johannes Girardoni's
   team unveiled the first satellite of perception in the heart of Venice
   Beach, [291]California. Through a collaboration with [292]Google,
   [293]Milan Design Week showcased how the interplay of light and color
   can go on tour as a walk-in installation on a larger scale.

[301]7 Bioclimatic Façade Strategies for Tropical Architecture

   [302]7 Bioclimatic Façade Strategies for Tropical Architecture -
   Featured Image Tropical Shed / Laurent Troost Architectures © Joana
   França

   When we think of the word "[303]tropic," the image that typically comes
   to mind is an [304]exotic space, characterized by perpetual warmth and
   humidity, with frequent and heavy [305]rainfall nurturing lush
   [306]vegetation. Throughout history, this [307]tropical climate has
   been romanticized as a paradise and criticized for potentially
   fostering weakness due to its perceived clemency.

   Thankfully, those judgments and associations have been relegated to the
   past, paving the way for theoretical and practical projects that
   outline the advantages and disadvantages of living in a tropical
   climate. These projects acknowledge the various strategies to enhance
   human [308]adaptability within these distinctive climatic conditions.

[316]Crafting Atmospheres: Sensory, Textured Lighting in Architectural Design

   March 05, 2024 | Sponsored Content

   [317]Crafting Atmospheres: Sensory, Textured Lighting in Architectural
   Design - Featured Image Cortesia de Vibia

   Flat and polished surfaces tend to evoke feelings of coldness and
   sterility, while raw, natural materials can create a sense of warmth
   and connection. Textures can trigger memories and emotions, connecting
   us to past experiences and the sense of touch. In the seminal book "The
   Eyes of the Skin", [318]Juhani Pallasmaa emphasizes the importance of
   sensory perception in architecture and objects beyond sight,
   particularly the role of touch and texture in shaping our experience.
   According to Pallasmaa, contemporary culture, influenced by technology
   and visual media, has overemphasized the visual aspect of spaces,
   neglecting other senses, especially touch, which is vital for
   understanding and appreciating the surrounding environment.
